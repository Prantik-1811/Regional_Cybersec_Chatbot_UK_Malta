Reject All Save My Preferences Accept All Powered by Reject All Save My Preferences Accept All Blog Post What Zero Trust Really Means Ellie-Rose Howe - 30 September 2025 Estimated reading time: 5 minutes Contents Cutting through the confusion to understand what Zero Trust security looks like in action What is Zero Trust? Why traditional security models no longer work Zero Trust is not a product A phased journey to Zero Trust Why Zero Trust matters Final thoughts: Zero Trust done right Download our Full Guide here: Cutting through the confusion to understand what Zero Trust security looks like in action Zero Trust is everywhere, but few are doing it properly. If you work in cybersecurity or IT, you have likely heard the phrase Zero Trust . It comes up in vendor pitches, boardroom discussions, and every other security trend report. But in practice, very few organisations have truly adopted Zero Trust. In fact, fewer than 25 percent of organisations have fully implemented Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA). Most have only taken the first steps. So, what does Zero Trust really mean? And what does it take to implement it effectively? What is Zero Trust? Zero Trust is a cybersecurity strategy that assumes no user or system should be trusted by default. Every user, device, application, and action must be verified before access is granted. Instead of trusting everything inside a network perimeter, Zero Trust applies continuous validation to every request. In short: Never trust, always verify . This approach significantly reduces the risk of insider threats, credential misuse, and lateral movement in the event of a breach. Why traditional security models no longer work Many legacy networks rely on perimeter-based security. The idea was simple: build strong defences around the organisation, and everything inside is safe. That model no longer reflects how modern businesses operate. Today: Users log in from remote locations Cloud environments are widely adopted Devices are mobile and constantly changing Threat actors are targeting identities and access controls Perimeter security trusts too much. It allows attackers who breach the perimeter to move laterally without resistance. This exposes critical systems and sensitive data. Zero Trust security addresses these weaknesses by requiring ongoing verification and limiting access at every level. Zero Trust is not a product One of the biggest misconceptions is that Zero Trust is a tool you can buy and deploy overnight. In reality, Zero Trust is a long-term security model that brings together processes, policies, and technologies. A mature Zero Trust implementation includes: Visibility into users, devices, applications, and data Granular access controls based on user role and context Network segmentation to reduce attack surfaces Continuous authentication and monitoring Least privilege access as a default A phased journey to Zero Trust Zero Trust security cannot be achieved in a single project. It requires a phased approach with a clear roadmap. At Reliance Cyber, we guide organisations through four key stages: 1. Discovery Map users, devices, data, and systems. Identify visibility gaps and understand how access is currently managed. 2. Segmentation Limit lateral movement by isolating critical systems and enforcing internal boundaries. 3. Deployment Introduce policy-based controls, adaptive authentication, and enforcement at all access points. 4. Refinement Review, test, and improve your Zero Trust implementation over time to respond to changing risks. You do not need to do everything at once. But you do need to move forward with a defined plan. Why Zero Trust matters The benefits of a Zero Trust security model include: Stronger protection against credential-based attacks Improved control over sensitive systems and data Faster response to security incidents Greater resilience against both internal and external threats Better alignment with compliance and governance standards More importantly, Zero Trust gives security teams the tools and frameworks to adapt to how people really work today. It supports hybrid working, cloud infrastructure, and BYOD environments without compromising protection. Final thoughts: Zero Trust done right Zero Trust is not a checkbox or a buzzword. It is a mindset and a framework for reducing risk in a fast-moving digital world. To get it right, you need a clear plan, executive support, and cross-functional collaboration. You also need the right mix of tools and visibility to make continuous validation possible.. If your organisation is still relying on a perimeter-based model, now is the time to evolve.

It allows attackers who breach the perimeter to move laterally without resistance. This exposes critical systems and sensitive data. Zero Trust security addresses these weaknesses by requiring ongoing verification and limiting access at every level. Zero Trust is not a product One of the biggest misconceptions is that Zero Trust is a tool you can buy and deploy overnight. In reality, Zero Trust is a long-term security model that brings together processes, policies, and technologies. A mature Zero Trust implementation includes: Visibility into users, devices, applications, and data Granular access controls based on user role and context Network segmentation to reduce attack surfaces Continuous authentication and monitoring Least privilege access as a default A phased journey to Zero Trust Zero Trust security cannot be achieved in a single project. It requires a phased approach with a clear roadmap. At Reliance Cyber, we guide organisations through four key stages: 1. Discovery Map users, devices, data, and systems. Identify visibility gaps and understand how access is currently managed. 2. Segmentation Limit lateral movement by isolating critical systems and enforcing internal boundaries. 3. Deployment Introduce policy-based controls, adaptive authentication, and enforcement at all access points. 4. Refinement Review, test, and improve your Zero Trust implementation over time to respond to changing risks. You do not need to do everything at once. But you do need to move forward with a defined plan. Why Zero Trust matters The benefits of a Zero Trust security model include: Stronger protection against credential-based attacks Improved control over sensitive systems and data Faster response to security incidents Greater resilience against both internal and external threats Better alignment with compliance and governance standards More importantly, Zero Trust gives security teams the tools and frameworks to adapt to how people really work today. It supports hybrid working, cloud infrastructure, and BYOD environments without compromising protection. Final thoughts: Zero Trust done right Zero Trust is not a checkbox or a buzzword. It is a mindset and a framework for reducing risk in a fast-moving digital world. To get it right, you need a clear plan, executive support, and cross-functional collaboration. You also need the right mix of tools and visibility to make continuous validation possible.. If your organisation is still relying on a perimeter-based model, now is the time to evolve.

If you work in cybersecurity or IT, you have likely heard the phrase Zero Trust . It comes up in vendor pitches, boardroom discussions, and every other security trend report. But in practice, very few organisations have truly adopted Zero Trust. In fact, fewer than 25 percent of organisations have fully implemented Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA). Most have only taken the first steps. So, what does Zero Trust really mean? And what does it take to implement it effectively? What is Zero Trust? Zero Trust is a cybersecurity strategy that assumes no user or system should be trusted by default. Every user, device, application, and action must be verified before access is granted. Instead of trusting everything inside a network perimeter, Zero Trust applies continuous validation to every request. In short: Never trust, always verify . This approach significantly reduces the risk of insider threats, credential misuse, and lateral movement in the event of a breach. Why traditional security models no longer work Many legacy networks rely on perimeter-based security. The idea was simple: build strong defences around the organisation, and everything inside is safe. That model no longer reflects how modern businesses operate. Today: Users log in from remote locations Cloud environments are widely adopted Devices are mobile and constantly changing Threat actors are targeting identities and access controls Perimeter security trusts too much. It allows attackers who breach the perimeter to move laterally without resistance. This exposes critical systems and sensitive data.
