IN DETAIL XDR FAQs How does XDR differ from traditional threat detection methods? XDR (Extended Detection and Response) stands out from traditional threat detection methods by offering a more intelligent and integrated approach: Comprehensive data collection: XDR gathers security data from a variety of domains—like endpoints, networks, cloud environments, and applications. This gives a unified view of potential threats, unlike traditional systems that focus on one area at a time. Automated analysis: With advanced analytics and machine learning, XDR processes and correlates data across different sources much faster and more accurately than older, isolated systems. Unified response: XDR centralises detection and response, allowing security teams to investigate and resolve threats from a single platform. This streamlined process significantly cuts down response times, helping to contain threats more effectively. How does the SOC function in XDR services? The Security Operations Center (SOC) is the heart of our XDR services, playing a crucial role by: Monitoring and analysing threat data : The SOC continuously tracks security information from multiple sources, using advanced analytics to detect and flag potential risks. Prioritising and investigating alerts : Our SOC experts assess the risk level of each alert and conduct detailed investigations to confirm and measure the scope of any threats detected. Coordinating response efforts : The SOC works closely with other security teams to take swift, decisive action—whether that means isolating compromised systems, blocking harmful traffic, or restoring affected services. What role do experts play in the XDR process? Our team of security experts plays a vital role in making XDR services as effective as possible: Configuring and optimising the XDR solution : We tailor the XDR platform to fit your organisation’s unique security needs and continually fine-tune it to address evolving threats. Providing threat hunting and investigation : Our experts proactively seek out hidden threats, carry out detailed forensic investigations, and analyse threat intelligence to improve detection capabilities. Advising on response and remediation : We offer strategic guidance on how best to respond to and recover from threats, while also helping you strengthen your overall security posture. What is Extended Detection and Response (XDR)? Extended Detection and Response (XDR) is an advanced cybersecurity solution that consolidates and correlates security data from a range of sources—such as endpoints, networks, and cloud environments—into one single platform. By using machine learning and advanced analytics, XDR detects and responds to complex, multi-stage attacks that may bypass traditional security systems. How does XDR improve the speed and accuracy of threat detection? XDR enhances the speed and accuracy of threat detection in several key ways: Automated data collection and analysis : XDR automates the process of gathering and analysing security data from different sources, significantly cutting down the time and effort needed compared to manual methods. Prioritisation and alert reduction : XDR’s advanced analytics help prioritise the most critical threats and minimise false positives, allowing security teams to focus on the threats that matter most. Prioritisation and alert reduction : XDR’s advanced analytics help prioritise the most critical threats and minimise false positives, allowing security teams to focus on the threats that matter most. Can Reliance Cyber’s XDR services be tailored to specific business needs? Yes, Reliance Cyber’s XDR services are fully customisable to suit your organisation’s specific needs. The platform is designed for flexibility and scalability, allowing seamless integration with your existing security tools. We also configure the detection and response strategies to align with your risk profile and security goals. What types of threats can XDR detect and respond to? Reliance Cyber’s XDR services are capable of detecting and responding to a wide variety of threats, including: Advanced persistent threats (APTs) : XDR can uncover complex, multi-stage attacks that target specific organisations or individuals. Ransomware and malware : XDR uses behaviour analysis and known threat indicators to detect and stop the spread of ransomware and other malicious software.

Automated analysis: With advanced analytics and machine learning, XDR processes and correlates data across different sources much faster and more accurately than older, isolated systems. Unified response: XDR centralises detection and response, allowing security teams to investigate and resolve threats from a single platform. This streamlined process significantly cuts down response times, helping to contain threats more effectively. How does the SOC function in XDR services? The Security Operations Center (SOC) is the heart of our XDR services, playing a crucial role by: Monitoring and analysing threat data : The SOC continuously tracks security information from multiple sources, using advanced analytics to detect and flag potential risks. Prioritising and investigating alerts : Our SOC experts assess the risk level of each alert and conduct detailed investigations to confirm and measure the scope of any threats detected. Coordinating response efforts : The SOC works closely with other security teams to take swift, decisive action—whether that means isolating compromised systems, blocking harmful traffic, or restoring affected services. What role do experts play in the XDR process? Our team of security experts plays a vital role in making XDR services as effective as possible: Configuring and optimising the XDR solution : We tailor the XDR platform to fit your organisation’s unique security needs and continually fine-tune it to address evolving threats.

Extended Detection and Response (XDR) is an advanced cybersecurity solution that consolidates and correlates security data from a range of sources—such as endpoints, networks, and cloud environments—into one single platform. By using machine learning and advanced analytics, XDR detects and responds to complex, multi-stage attacks that may bypass traditional security systems. How does XDR improve the speed and accuracy of threat detection? XDR enhances the speed and accuracy of threat detection in several key ways: Automated data collection and analysis : XDR automates the process of gathering and analysing security data from different sources, significantly cutting down the time and effort needed compared to manual methods. Prioritisation and alert reduction : XDR’s advanced analytics help prioritise the most critical threats and minimise false positives, allowing security teams to focus on the threats that matter most.

Can Reliance Cyber’s XDR services be tailored to specific business needs? Yes, Reliance Cyber’s XDR services are fully customisable to suit your organisation’s specific needs. The platform is designed for flexibility and scalability, allowing seamless integration with your existing security tools. We also configure the detection and response strategies to align with your risk profile and security goals. What types of threats can XDR detect and respond to? Reliance Cyber’s XDR services are capable of detecting and responding to a wide variety of threats, including: Advanced persistent threats (APTs) : XDR can uncover complex, multi-stage attacks that target specific organisations or individuals. Ransomware and malware : XDR uses behaviour analysis and known threat indicators to detect and stop the spread of ransomware and other malicious software. Insider threats : By tracking suspicious internal activities, XDR helps mitigate the risk of insider threats from within your organisation. How does XDR contribute to overall cybersecurity resilience? XDR strengthens your organisation’s cybersecurity resilience by: Increasing visibility and reducing blind spots : XDR collects data from multiple sources, offering a comprehensive view of your security environment, which reduces the chance of undetected threats. Enabling faster response and recovery : With automation and integrated responses, XDR ensures faster containment and remediation of threats, minimising any disruption to your operations. Supporting continuous improvement : XDR provides valuable insights that can help refine detection rules, update threat intelligence, and improve your security processes over time. How can businesses get started with Reliance Cyber’s XDR services? Getting started with Reliance Cyber’s XDR services is simple. Begin by scheduling a consultation where we can discuss your organisation’s specific security needs and goals. From there, our experts will assess your current security posture, identify any gaps, and recommend the most suitable XDR solution. After the assessment, we’ll deploy and configure the XDR platform, ensuring it integrates seamlessly with your existing tools and systems. We also offer comprehensive training and ongoing support to make sure your team can effectively use the XDR platform and respond to threats with confidence. How does XDR differ from traditional threat detection methods? XDR (Extended Detection and Response) stands out from traditional threat detection methods by offering a more intelligent and integrated approach: Comprehensive data collection: XDR gathers security data from a variety of domains—like endpoints, networks, cloud environments, and applications. This gives a unified view of potential threats, unlike traditional systems that focus on one area at a time. Automated analysis: With advanced analytics and machine learning, XDR processes and correlates data across different sources much faster and more accurately than older, isolated systems. Unified response: XDR centralises detection and response, allowing security teams to investigate and resolve threats from a single platform. This streamlined process significantly cuts down response times, helping to contain threats more effectively. How does the SOC function in XDR services? The Security Operations Center (SOC) is the heart of our XDR services, playing a crucial role by: Monitoring and analysing threat data : The SOC continuously tracks security information from multiple sources, using advanced analytics to detect and flag potential risks. Prioritising and investigating alerts : Our SOC experts assess the risk level of each alert and conduct detailed investigations to confirm and measure the scope of any threats detected. Coordinating response efforts : The SOC works closely with other security teams to take swift, decisive action—whether that means isolating compromised systems, blocking harmful traffic, or restoring affected services. What role do experts play in the XDR process? Our team of security experts plays a vital role in making XDR services as effective as possible: Configuring and optimising the XDR solution : We tailor the XDR platform to fit your organisation’s unique security needs and continually fine-tune it to address evolving threats. Providing threat hunting and investigation : Our experts proactively seek out hidden threats, carry out detailed forensic investigations, and analyse threat intelligence to improve detection capabilities.
