Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) CTI as-a-Service (CTIaaS) We provide proactive support to Clients, helping them better understand threats, enrich security data, & contextualise security events. A force-multiplier for your security. Our Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) provides ‘push’ and ‘on-demand’ access to a broad range of data, collated and curated from commercial and open-source feeds, dark web monitoring, and social media. This is in addition to our own proprietary threat intelligence sources and identifies the latest Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), and malware. Via a secure web-based client portal, we provide regular tailored threat reports and advisories based on your specific needs, technology profile, and industry sector, as well as an on-demand Request For Information (RFI) service to your security analysts, including Malware Analysis. Speak to us Our Approach CYSIAM’s team of experienced threat analysts conducts independent research and analysis of commercial, closed, and open-source data in line with our clients’ Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs) defined during onboarding and regularly reviewed. We have access to a significant number of threat feeds and Malware Information Sharing Platforms (MISPs), including that of the globally-recognised Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), of which CYSIAM is a Full Member. This information is collated and curated in our own MISP and TIP and accessed by our clients via a secure client portal. This client portal allows our clients to create and track tickets or RFIs, access client-specific and general reports and threat advisories, and access / query the CYSIAM MISP. Benefits Proactive Detection & Prevention: CTIaaS enables organisations to stay ahead of cyber threats by providing real-time intelligence on emerging tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers. This proactive approach helps prevent breaches before they occur, rather than reacting after the fact. Efficiency & Optimisation: By outsourcing threat intelligence to specialised providers, organisations can access high-quality, up-to-date threat data without the need to build and maintain expensive in-house intelligence teams or infrastructure. This reduces costs and allows internal teams to focus on core security functions. Enhanced Decision-Making: CTIaaS delivers actionable insights tailored to an organisation’s industry, technology stack, and threat landscape. These insights support faster, more informed decision-making during incident response and improve overall security posture through better risk prioritisation. Improved Collaboration: We aggregate intelligence from sources across critical industries and high-threat geographies. This contextualised and rich intelligence helps clients mitigate the risk of threats that may not yet have affected their own networks, enabling more comprehensive and timely defence.
