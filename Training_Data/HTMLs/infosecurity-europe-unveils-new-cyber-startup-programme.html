SecurityBrief UK - Technology news for CISOs & cybersecurity decision-makers United Kingdom Guides # cloud security # cybersecurity # endpoint protection # firewalls # ransomware Search # Cybersecurity # IT Industry # SMB Infosecurity Europe unveils new Cyber Startup Programme Tue, 3rd Feb 2026 By Sofiah Nichole Salivio, News Editor Infosecurity Europe has unveiled a new Cyber Startup Programme scheduled for its upcoming event at ExCeL London. Hosted as part of the 2026 exhibition, the initiative is designed to provide early-stage cybersecurity firms with a dedicated platform, offering bespoke content and a designated physical space within the venue to showcase their innovations. As part of the launch, the organisers have introduced a new award competition, which will be delivered in partnership with UK Cyber Flywheel. This addition aims to further incentivise growth and recognition for emerging businesses within the sector. Infosecurity Europe is a prominent fixture within the RX global events portfolio, serving as a primary hub for cybersecurity vendors, buyers, investors, and industry specialists. By integrating this startup-focused programme, the event seeks to foster entrepreneurship and strengthen the pipeline of new technology entering the cybersecurity market. Startup focus The Cyber Startup Programmeme will centre on a Cyber Startups Zone on the exhibition floor. Infosecurity Europe said the zone will give startups space to show products and meet potential customers, partners and investors. The programme also includes targeted tickets for different groups. Infosecurity Europe said it will offer tailored tickets for startup founders, investors and "startup enablers". Infosecurity Europe positioned the programme as part of a wider push on innovation themes across the event. The organiser said it will add conference sessions aimed at founders and will run a dedicated track focused on scaling and go-to-market considerations. Brad Maule-ffinch, Event Director, Infosecurity Europe, said: "Supporting early-stage innovation is essential to the future of cybersecurity, and being able to play a meaningful role in spotlighting upcoming innovative and disruptive technologies is a role we are keen to foster and grow. With the launch of the Cyber Startup Programmeme, Infosecurity Europe is creating new opportunities for startups to gain visibility, connect with investors and buyers and use it as a platform to grow too." Award competition Infosecurity Europe said UK Cyber Flywheel will collaborate on the programme. A dedicated day of founder and investor-focused content and networking will sit alongside a live pitch competition, with finalists presenting to an audience of senior industry figures, investors and buyers. The organiser said the winner of the Infosecurity Europe Cyber Startup Award 2026 will receive a free exhibition stand at Infosecurity Europe 2027. The prize package also includes PR support and a brand consultancy and workshop package. Applicants will submit a written entry of up to 1,000 words. Infosecurity Europe said entries must include a company summary, product details and competitive differentiation. One aim is to connect startup founders with investors and established cyber security buyers. Infosecurity Europe said it will use show-floor activity, sessions and networking to bring those groups together. UK Cyber Flywheel UK Cyber Flywheel describes itself as a collaboration that connects CISOs, founders, investors and government. Infosecurity Europe said the group will play a role in programme delivery and content. "Cybersecurity is crucial for the UK to protect its critical infrastructure, economy and citizens from increasingly sophisticated state-sponsored and criminal cyberattacks. Through the Cyber Flywheel, and in partnership with CISOs, founders, investors and government, we are focused on building a better connected, stronger and more resilient cyber ecosystem across the UK and beyond. The Cyber Startup Programmeme at Infosecurity Europe plays an important role in bringing these communities together and accelerating innovation where it matters most," said Munawar Valiji CISO, Cyber Advisor, representing UK Cyber Flywheel. Innovation zone Infosecurity Europe also set out plans for a separate Cyber Innovation Zone. It said the feature will be delivered in partnership with the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology. The organiser said the Cyber Innovation Zone will highlight UK micro, small and medium-sized cyber security businesses. It will include a showcase of approaches and initiatives backed by government, alongside what Infosecurity Europe described as breakthrough technologies. The Startup Programmeme and Innovation Zone sit within the wider exhibition and conference schedule. Infosecurity Europe said attendees will have access to the show floor and multiple theatres with speaker line-ups that include senior figures from the sector. Infosecurity Europe said it has opened registration for the event. It also set out an admission price of £49 after a free registration period. The organiser said the Cyber Startup Programmeme will make its debut at Infosecurity Europe 2026 at ExCeL London.
