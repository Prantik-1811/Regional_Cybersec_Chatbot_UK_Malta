Reject All Save My Preferences Accept All Powered by Reject All Save My Preferences Accept All News & Events Reliance Cyber joins Google Cloud Partner Advantage Program and Launches Its SecOps MDR Service on Google Cloud Marketplace. Giulia Foss - 13 February 2025 Estimated reading time: 4 minutes Contents Why This Matters Security without the barriers London, 13 th February, 2025 Reliance Cyber, a leading UK Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP), has launched its Google SecOps MDR service on Google Cloud Marketplace , making advanced security operations more accessible to businesses. Organisations can now seamlessly access Reliance Cyber’s MDR (Managed Detection and Response) service, powered by Google SecOps, to improve threat visibility, detect risks faster, and enhance security without the usual complexity. By offering this service on Google Cloud Marketplace, Reliance Cyber is helping businesses reduce security costs, eliminate operational burdens, and strengthen cyber resilience. “Joining Google Cloud Marketplace has reduced customer purchasing friction allowing us to secure businesses faster, at a reduced cost while improving protection,” …said James Lee, Chief Revenue Officer at Reliance Cyber, he continued… “Dynamism is key to what we provide. We optimise threat ingestion, automate detection, and respond in less than a minute, removing the distracting overhead preventing customers from supporting business improvements. Why This Matters Reliance Cyber’s Google SecOps MDR service addresses key security challenges faced by organisations today: Cost-effective security through optimised log ingestion – Rising data processing costs shouldn’t compromise security. By streamlining log ingestion, we ensure businesses maintain comprehensive security visibility without escalating expenses, allowing them to optimise budgets while defending against evolving threats. Instant visibility with next-gen SIEM & SOAR – Legacy SIEM solutions slow businesses down. Our production-ready SIEM and SOAR deploy in just 30 minutes, enabling immediate log onboarding and real-time threat detection. This eliminates costly delays, so security teams can focus on response, not setup. AI-driven automation for scalable security operations – Managing security manually is no longer sustainable. Our AI-powered SOAR has executed 15.8 million automated SOC actions in the last six months—99.75% fully automated—while Google’s GTI telemetry (2.4B VirusTotal records) enhances proactive threat detection. This reduces human toil, allowing security teams to scale effortlessly and focus on high-value investigations. Sub-one-minute threat response for maximum protection – With 900+ custom detection analytics, 1,800+ automated analyst playbook actions, and dynamic threat scoring, we reduce response times to under one minute, slashing dwell time and neutralising threats before they can impact business operations. Addressing talent shortages and analyst retention issues – Our dedicated security teams provide expertise that companies might struggle to hire and retain in-house. “Businesses need security that adapts to their needs, without the burden of large in-house teams or excessive budgets,” …said Lawrence Munro, Chief Technology Officer at Reliance Cyber…. “Google’s security ecosystem lays the groundwork for scalable, high-performance security operations. By lowering data costs, automating threat detection, and enhancing alert accuracy, we enable organisations to cut through the noise and focus on real threats. With Reliance Cyber’s Google-powered MDR service, this capability is now more effective and accessible than ever.” Security without the barriers By listing on Google Cloud Marketplace, Reliance Cyber makes it easier for organisations to adopt proactive, AI-driven cybersecurity without long procurement cycles or complex integrations. With 24/7 support from UK-based SC-cleared cybersecurity experts, businesses gain access to an optimised, fully managed security service tailored to their needs.
