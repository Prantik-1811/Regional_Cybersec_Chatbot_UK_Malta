News As we near the end of an eventful 2024, CyberCrowd is thrilled to share some of the strides we’ve made over the past year. From expanding our services to receiving industry accolades, we’ve focused on meeting the evolving needs of our clients in the face of complex cyber challenges. Since establishing our roots in Newbury, CyberCrowd has remained dedicated to helping businesses protect their assets and build resilience against cyber threats. This year, we moved to a larger office in Newbury to accommodate our growth and launched our 24/7/365 UK-based Managed Security Operations Centre (SOC), further enhancing our ability to deliver around-the-clock protection for clients. A defining aspect of our work is our commitment to empowering small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), where the need for effective cybersecurity solutions is especially critical. As an accredited Cyber Advisor for the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), we offer accessible guidance to help SMBs build a robust cyber foundation. Our advice focuses on four key pillars: fostering a culture of security awareness, ensuring strong incident response plans are in place, encouraging collaboration across teams, and prioritising continuous improvement. This approach, built on practical guidance and shared expertise, has proven instrumental in supporting businesses across the Thames Valley. The past year has been marked not only by our growth but also by our clients’ resilience. With the cyber landscape growing more complex, businesses face an urgent need to respond quickly to threats. We have been privileged to support our clients throughout these incidents, offering technical expertise alongside strategic guidance. We believe a strong cybersecurity foundation begins with training, awareness, and a culture that encourages vigilance. In our experience, organisations that integrate cybersecurity into their daily operations are better prepared to face challenges head-on. CyberCrowd’s commitment to excellence has not gone unnoticed. This year, we were honoured to be named Cyber Security Company of the Year and to be recognised by The Sunday Times as one of the Best Places to Work. But perhaps our most rewarding accolade has been winning the Thames Valley Chamber of Commerce’s Employer of the Year 2024 award. This award reflects the dedication of our exceptional team, whose skill and commitment are the backbone of CyberCrowd’s success. The support of our customers and partners has been integral to our growth, and we are grateful for their trust. Our journey would not be possible without our team’s technical achievements and the specialised expertise they bring. With certifications in Threat Led Penetration Testing (TLPT), incident response, NCSC Cyber Incident Exercising, and the rare NCSC Cyber Incident Response Level 2 certification, our experts continuously advance their knowledge to stay ahead of industry developments. This specialised skill set allows us to provide tailored solutions that strengthen clients’ defences and improve operational resilience. As a member of the Thames Valley Chamber of Commerce, one of the UK’s most dynamic business communities, we’re excited to deepen our relationships and contribute to the region’s ongoing success. Looking ahead to 2025, CyberCrowd is poised for further growth, with exciting new plans on the horizon, including interactive Cyber Escape Rooms that bring a hands-on, engaging twist to cybersecurity training. These innovative spaces will be designed to make learning cybersecurity fun, challenging, and immersive, reinforcing skills while adding a memorable experience. We also want to take a moment to express our heartfelt thanks to our customers and partners for their continued support and trust in CyberCrowd. Your collaboration and confidence in us have been instrumental in driving our growth and innovation. As we step into 2025, we’re excited to continue working alongside you, delivering tailored solutions and building a safer, more secure digital future together. To learn more about how we can support your cybersecurity journey, please reach out. We look forward to growing together, securing together, and innovating together.

From expanding our services to receiving industry accolades, we’ve focused on meeting the evolving needs of our clients in the face of complex cyber challenges. Since establishing our roots in Newbury, CyberCrowd has remained dedicated to helping businesses protect their assets and build resilience against cyber threats. This year, we moved to a larger office in Newbury to accommodate our growth and launched our 24/7/365 UK-based Managed Security Operations Centre (SOC), further enhancing our ability to deliver around-the-clock protection for clients. A defining aspect of our work is our commitment to empowering small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), where the need for effective cybersecurity solutions is especially critical. As an accredited Cyber Advisor for the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), we offer accessible guidance to help SMBs build a robust cyber foundation. Our advice focuses on four key pillars: fostering a culture of security awareness, ensuring strong incident response plans are in place, encouraging collaboration across teams, and prioritising continuous improvement. This approach, built on practical guidance and shared expertise, has proven instrumental in supporting businesses across the Thames Valley. The past year has been marked not only by our growth but also by our clients’ resilience. With the cyber landscape growing more complex, businesses face an urgent need to respond quickly to threats. We have been privileged to support our clients throughout these incidents, offering technical expertise alongside strategic guidance. We believe a strong cybersecurity foundation begins with training, awareness, and a culture that encourages vigilance. In our experience, organisations that integrate cybersecurity into their daily operations are better prepared to face challenges head-on. CyberCrowd’s commitment to excellence has not gone unnoticed. This year, we were honoured to be named Cyber Security Company of the Year and to be recognised by The Sunday Times as one of the Best Places to Work. But perhaps our most rewarding accolade has been winning the Thames Valley Chamber of Commerce’s Employer of the Year 2024 award. This award reflects the dedication of our exceptional team, whose skill and commitment are the backbone of CyberCrowd’s success. The support of our customers and partners has been integral to our growth, and we are grateful for their trust. Our journey would not be possible without our team’s technical achievements and the specialised expertise they bring. With certifications in Threat Led Penetration Testing (TLPT), incident response, NCSC Cyber Incident Exercising, and the rare NCSC Cyber Incident Response Level 2 certification, our experts continuously advance their knowledge to stay ahead of industry developments. This specialised skill set allows us to provide tailored solutions that strengthen clients’ defences and improve operational resilience. As a member of the Thames Valley Chamber of Commerce, one of the UK’s most dynamic business communities, we’re excited to deepen our relationships and contribute to the region’s ongoing success. Looking ahead to 2025, CyberCrowd is poised for further growth, with exciting new plans on the horizon, including interactive Cyber Escape Rooms that bring a hands-on, engaging twist to cybersecurity training. These innovative spaces will be designed to make learning cybersecurity fun, challenging, and immersive, reinforcing skills while adding a memorable experience. We also want to take a moment to express our heartfelt thanks to our customers and partners for their continued support and trust in CyberCrowd.
