SecurityBrief UK - Technology news for CISOs & cybersecurity decision-makers United Kingdom Guides # cloud security # cybersecurity # endpoint protection # firewalls # ransomware Search # Firewalls # Encryption # Network Security Apex champions proactive firewall upgrades for MSPs Mon, 2nd Feb 2026 By Gaëlle Perrin, Senior Director, Global Field/Partner Marketing Programs & Communications, SonicWall From early roadmapping to ongoing education, Apex Computing builds trust by making upgrades part of a long-term security strategy. Making security a planned investment, not a crisis reaction Founded in 2023 and headquartered in Manchester, Apex Computing Services is a SonicWall Platinum Partner managing 200 businesses and 4,500 end users. Their approach shows how proactive upgrade strategies protect clients, strengthen relationships and ultimately improve business performance. Managing Director Daniel Shone is clear about where responsibility lies: "Most MSPs and MSSPs, for the vast majority of the clients they support, will be advising the business owner about what they should have on their roadmap, and we should be advising that well in advance." By leading these conversations, Apex avoids the performance issues, security vulnerabilities and customer frustration that come from outdated firewalls. Why upgrades matter beyond security Many clients see firewall upgrades as an avoidable expense if their current device is "still working." But support for regular updates and patches eventually ends, leaving the firewall unable to keep pace with evolving threats. Daniel notes that modern protections demand more powerful hardware, especially for advanced capabilities like DPI-SSL inspection, bandwidth-intensive threat detection, and modern encryption handling. "Devices need to be adequately spec to be able to deal with technology such as DPI SSL and to ensure that speed and levels of service and quality of services are always right for the clients," he says. Even firewalls just three to five years old can struggle with these requirements. Avoiding the "Distressed Purchase" Waiting until a security incident forces a replacement is the costliest way to upgrade. "Sometimes it does turn into a distressed purchase because a client might have had a breach and the newest version of the firewall should have been in place, but that isn't the position you want to be in," Shone says. Proactive upgrades allow for planned budgeting cycles, proper implementation timelines, reduced business disruption and maintained client confidence - avoiding the stress and expense of emergency replacements. The Apex Upgrade playbook Apex has built its upgrade process around continual monitoring, strategic planning, and client education. Monthly estate reviews track performance and capacity, while regular review meetings keep customers informed of their current posture and potential future needs. Upgrades are typically roadmapped 18 months ahead, with growth planning built in for expanding businesses. Education is central to the process. "As an MSP, it's your responsibility to educate your customers on the risks and where they should invest, either in cybersecurity or other areas of IT," Daniel says. "This approach builds trust and ensures customers understand the value proposition before making investments." By comparing the client's current state with their desired security and business goals, Apex sets measurable targets - for example, moving from 40% SonicWall hardware coverage to 80% in 18 months, with 90% of the base already protected by SonicWall Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR). Thinking about cybersecurity like insurance Shone likens smart security investment to an insurance policy. "It's like buying insurance for your car, and you never want to deal with it. You don't want to have a crash... It's the same with investing in cybersecurity. Successful upgrades are measured not by dramatic improvements, but by the absence of problems. The goal is to reach a point where we never have to talk about cybersecurity again after it's gone in." Key practices for MSPs Shone's recommendations for peers include: Take the lead - don't wait for customers to request upgrades. Focus on education, framing upgrades as risk mitigation and continuity. Plan ahead to allow proper budgeting and avoid emergencies. Monitor monthly for early warning signs. Work closely with vendor support teams for smooth deployments. Building resilience through proactive upgrades For Apex, driving upgrades proactively demonstrates value, prevents security incidents, and strengthens client relationships. Positioning upgrades as part of a comprehensive, ongoing security strategy - rather than a disruptive expense - keeps clients protected and confident. As threats grow more sophisticated and technology demands increase, companies that keep their firewalls current and properly specified will be best positioned to maintain continuity and trust. Reactive upgrades after a damaging incident are far costlier in financial, reputational, and operational terms. Get to know Apex .
