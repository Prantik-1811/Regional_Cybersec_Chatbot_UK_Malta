News Cybersecurity – Everyone’s Responsibility In this age of technology, cybersecurity is no longer just a matter of concern to the security staff of a company. It’s implicated on everyone as anyone now can become a victim. Cybersecurity has taken a different landscape. Perpetrators are using more sophisticated schemes to breach information. More attacks are becoming highly targeted on specific users, such as phishing attacks on Office 365 users. Attackers are also evolving to take advantage of workplace technological changes such as cloud computing which not many people are aware of. As of now, network security is composed of more than safeguarding data, web applications and system organisation. It is now essential to have employees educated about cybersecurity as they could potentially be the weak links to hackers. So What Should You Do To Enhance Cybersecurity? Make Cybersecurity Awareness a Culture In The Organisation Employees are the main resource in any organisation as they are the ones who keep it going. Even though generating income is the main objective, it should not be done at the expense of risking the organisation. Establishing correct frameworks and security awareness training programs will go a long way in ensuring there’s an effective layer of defense. By extending this knowledge and responsibilities to employees, organisations can rest assured that they will prevent complex cyberattacks and save the company from financial and legal damages. It should be a mantra in the organisation that cybersecurity should be among the top objectives in the organisation. It should include what the employees should be aware of, what is expected to be seen, and the best practices in case of any penetration. Modern cybersecurity awareness involves making the human security wall more knowledgeable about the latest threats and how one can stop them. Make Sure You Don’t Overshare The three main factors sporting cyberattacks are the human factor, identity, and network vulnerabilities. Many people, including organisations, are sharing private information publicly, hence, exposing themselves to phishing attacks. The goal of such attacks is to deceive one into stealing financial funds or identities and access the organisation that employees have been entrusted with. Once a hacker gains access to an employee’s identity, then accessing the organisation’s information becomes easier without even getting detected. Employees use the internet to access online services, shop online, or interact with people on social media. It’s, therefore, an important mandate to ensure employees learn how vicious cyber criminals are into accessing any information they can. Studies show that they spend 90% of their time performing reconnaissance of their targets. Regular Tests To ensure that your employees are doing the right thing, you should always keep them in check by conducting random tests just to see if they are in line with what is to be followed. Hackers and cybercriminals keep changing techniques but the main one is still through email phishing. Then comes website infections, social media scams and stealing digital identities. Testing your employees by sending fake phishing emails or fake scams will determine whether they are up-to-date with the company’s strict rules. In case of poor performance, strict measures should be put in place. Besides retraining, disciplinary action should be taken and likewise, for those who performed tremendously, a reward should be put in place. What Can One Do To Be More Cyber Aware? It takes only one mistake from an employee to put the entire security of the company at risk. It doesn’t necessarily have to be in the workplace, it all begins at home. What Can One Do To Safeguard Themselves At Home? Use antivirus and antispyware software to protect yourself from potential malware Update your apps and software to ensure all bugs are fixed and there’s no way through Set up strong firewalls Create strong passwords and use password manager tools to safeguard yourself from any breach Report and delete any suspicious emails Always do routine backups in case of any breach that you could not avoid. Minimise personal information online Check and recheck privacy settings on all social apps Avoid public Wi-Fi and use VPNs if necessary. How Can You Safeguard Yourself In the Office? Train employees to always be alert about cyberattacks Come up with strict policies when it comes to the cybersecurity space Conduct security audits on a regular basis, such as double-blinded pen testing strategies Educate your employees about the risk of IOT in revealing their identity. Create key frameworks for safe password management Invest in the best security software and team there is Use two-factor or multi-factor authentication Encrypt your data when sending and receiving Always carry out automatic backups Always have a disaster-recovery plan. This can also be attributed to regular backups Update all software.

It’s implicated on everyone as anyone now can become a victim. Cybersecurity has taken a different landscape. Perpetrators are using more sophisticated schemes to breach information. More attacks are becoming highly targeted on specific users, such as phishing attacks on Office 365 users. Attackers are also evolving to take advantage of workplace technological changes such as cloud computing which not many people are aware of. As of now, network security is composed of more than safeguarding data, web applications and system organisation. It is now essential to have employees educated about cybersecurity as they could potentially be the weak links to hackers. So What Should You Do To Enhance Cybersecurity? Make Cybersecurity Awareness a Culture In The Organisation Employees are the main resource in any organisation as they are the ones who keep it going. Even though generating income is the main objective, it should not be done at the expense of risking the organisation. Establishing correct frameworks and security awareness training programs will go a long way in ensuring there’s an effective layer of defense. By extending this knowledge and responsibilities to employees, organisations can rest assured that they will prevent complex cyberattacks and save the company from financial and legal damages. It should be a mantra in the organisation that cybersecurity should be among the top objectives in the organisation. It should include what the employees should be aware of, what is expected to be seen, and the best practices in case of any penetration. Modern cybersecurity awareness involves making the human security wall more knowledgeable about the latest threats and how one can stop them. Make Sure You Don’t Overshare The three main factors sporting cyberattacks are the human factor, identity, and network vulnerabilities. Many people, including organisations, are sharing private information publicly, hence, exposing themselves to phishing attacks. The goal of such attacks is to deceive one into stealing financial funds or identities and access the organisation that employees have been entrusted with. Once a hacker gains access to an employee’s identity, then accessing the organisation’s information becomes easier without even getting detected. Employees use the internet to access online services, shop online, or interact with people on social media. It’s, therefore, an important mandate to ensure employees learn how vicious cyber criminals are into accessing any information they can. Studies show that they spend 90% of their time performing reconnaissance of their targets. Regular Tests To ensure that your employees are doing the right thing, you should always keep them in check by conducting random tests just to see if they are in line with what is to be followed. Hackers and cybercriminals keep changing techniques but the main one is still through email phishing. Then comes website infections, social media scams and stealing digital identities. Testing your employees by sending fake phishing emails or fake scams will determine whether they are up-to-date with the company’s strict rules. In case of poor performance, strict measures should be put in place. Besides retraining, disciplinary action should be taken and likewise, for those who performed tremendously, a reward should be put in place. What Can One Do To Be More Cyber Aware? It takes only one mistake from an employee to put the entire security of the company at risk. It doesn’t necessarily have to be in the workplace, it all begins at home. What Can One Do To Safeguard Themselves At Home? Use antivirus and antispyware software to protect yourself from potential malware Update your apps and software to ensure all bugs are fixed and there’s no way through Set up strong firewalls Create strong passwords and use password manager tools to safeguard yourself from any breach Report and delete any suspicious emails Always do routine backups in case of any breach that you could not avoid. Minimise personal information online Check and recheck privacy settings on all social apps Avoid public Wi-Fi and use VPNs if necessary. How Can You Safeguard Yourself In the Office?
