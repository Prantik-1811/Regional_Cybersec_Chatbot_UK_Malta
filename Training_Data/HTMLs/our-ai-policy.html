SecurityBrief UK - Technology news for CISOs & cybersecurity decision-makers United Kingdom Guides # cloud security # cybersecurity # endpoint protection # firewalls # ransomware Search Our AI Policy At TechDay, we are committed to transparency and integrity in our journalistic practices. Below is an outline of how we integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into our workflow while maintaining our core values of trust, accountability, and high-quality reporting. Human-driven journalism All of our journalists are real humans. We have 19 editors, journalists and contributors. You can find a list of our dedicated team members on the Our Team page . AI as a supplementary tool We use various AI tools to enhance employee happiness and productivity. These tools assist our team in research, drafting, and fact-checking but are not a replacement for human oversight. Commitment to employment We employ at least the same number of journalists as we did before incorporating AI tools, underscoring our ongoing commitment to human-led journalism and meaningful employment. Human oversight in every story Every story we publish is reviewed and approved by a human journalist. AI may support the process, but a human is always in the loop to ensure accuracy and quality. Accuracy and accountability Our use of AI has helped reduce the frequency of corrections compared to an entirely human-driven process. However, occasional mistakes may still occur. When they do, we are committed to addressing them promptly. Corrections policy If you identify a factual error in our reporting, please contact us at corrections@techday.com . We will investigate and rectify any inaccuracies as quickly as possible. Transparency and learning We retain source documents for all published stories to enable future reference, accountability, and continuous improvement. Feedback welcomed Your feedback is invaluable in helping us improve. Please share your thoughts on how we can continue to enhance the quality of our work. Contact us here . By combining human expertise with innovative AI tools, we strive to deliver high-quality journalism that informs and engages our audience while upholding the principles of trust and accountability.
