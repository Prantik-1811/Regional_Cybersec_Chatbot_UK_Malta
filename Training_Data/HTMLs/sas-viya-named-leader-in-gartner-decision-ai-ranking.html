ChannelLife Australia - Industry insider news for technology resellers Australia Guides # cloud services # cybersecurity # distributors # microsoft # partner programmes Search # Hybrid Cloud # Data Analytics # Multi-cloud SAS Viya named Leader in Gartner decision AI ranking Fri, 6th Feb 2026 (Today) By Melania Watson, Interview Editor SAS has been named a Leader in Gartner's inaugural Magic Quadrant for Decision Intelligence Platforms, with SAS Viya listed in the Leaders category. The recognition places SAS among vendors Gartner associates with "strong execution with a clear, forward-looking vision for decision-centric architectures," according to the research. Gartner's description of Leaders also cites coverage across the decision life cycle-modelling, orchestration, monitoring and governance-and the use of advanced AI techniques such as generative AI and agentic AI. Market shift Decision intelligence platforms have moved beyond early experimentation in many organisations, according to Gartner. The firm describes the market as late-stage emerging, with broader adoption across organisation sizes, geographies and industries, driven by demand for agility, resilience and measurable business impact. The category focuses on decision-centric architectures rather than analytics tooling in isolation. Gartner's framing highlights explicit decision modelling, AI-driven augmentation and automation, and governance at scale. SAS positions Viya as its flagship data and AI platform designed to meet demand for decision intelligence. It combines analytics and AI with governance and operational tooling, including decision governance, integrated analytics, simulation, optimisation and machine learning. SAS also links the platform to regulated and fast-changing environments, which often require formal controls over data use, audit trails, and sign-off processes for automated decision-making. Product focus SAS Viya is built around the decision life cycle, from definition to execution and monitoring. SAS highlights governance capabilities such as explainability, auditing, compliance and model governance-factors that often shape procurement in sectors with strict supervisory oversight. Industry use cases are central to how SAS markets the platform. It points to prebuilt models and packaged content for decisions in areas such as fraud detection and anti-money laundering, as well as clinical forecasting, supply chain optimisation, credit decisioning and demand planning. Viya also reflects a broader shift toward cloud-first analytics and AI platforms. SAS says it is designed for hybrid and multicloud environments, aligning with enterprise requirements to run software across multiple infrastructure providers and on-premise systems. Data location and jurisdiction remain key issues for large organisations, especially in financial services and government. SAS says Viya can be deployed where data resides, supporting regional compliance and data sovereignty requirements. SAS describes Viya as "end-to-end decision intelligence," spanning decision modelling, execution, monitoring and governance. It also says the platform supports human-led, machine-led and collaborative decision processes. Competitive context The decision intelligence label has expanded as organisations adopt more automation across operational processes. Many now treat decisioning as a repeatable product capability rather than a one-off data science project, increasing demand for tools that manage models, rules, workflows and oversight in a single operating framework. The category also overlaps with data science, model operations, business rules management, workflow automation and governance tooling. Vendors increasingly combine capabilities that were previously procured separately as buyers look for simpler operating models and clearer accountability. SAS has long been established in analytics and risk modelling, particularly in regulated industries. As decision intelligence platforms emphasise governance and auditability, that background may appeal to buyers seeking consistency from model development through to production decisioning. SAS pointed to heightened competition in enterprise AI as a driver of increased buyer scrutiny. Bryan Harris, the company's chief technology officer, linked the Gartner recognition to the need for trusted technology in a crowded market. "The intensity of today's enterprise AI market is at an all-time high," said Bryan Harris, Chief Technology Officer, SAS. "At SAS, we are in a relentless pursuit to help organisations navigate the noise, implement trusted technology and gain a decision advantage." Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Decision Intelligence Platforms, authored by David Pidsley, Carlie Idoine, Gareth Herschel, Kevin Quinn and Kjell Carlsson, evaluates vendors on their ability to deliver decision-centric architectures and governance at scale.
