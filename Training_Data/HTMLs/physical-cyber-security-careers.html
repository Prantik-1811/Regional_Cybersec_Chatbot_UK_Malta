Home / Careers in Cyber Security / Physical Cyber Security Careers Physical cyber security roles involve the prevention and detection of attack, as well as responsive measures if attacks occur. To do this from a physical point of view, systems, networks and more will be tested and protected to minimise risk. Within physical cyber security, there are various career paths focused on different aspects of access and threat. These include: Ethical Hacking Ethical hacking tests the cyber security of an organisation by legally hacking into their systems and networks in the same way an attacker might. This helps to spot gaps in security and from here, improvements can be implemented to further secure an organisation. As well as addressing security measures such as access controls and CCTV, physical ethical hackers also test hardware. The more ‘smart devices’ become embedded in the workplace, the greater the demand for ethical hackers who can specialise in physical security. Security Engineering In order to effectively protect an organisation, a layered approach must be taken. With this, a security engineer will build these layers, which may include firewalls, encryption and email security systems. Cloud Security Today, many organisations use cloud space to store data and carry out daily tasks, which of course still require protection. Those working within cloud security roles will mitigate against the threat of cloud environments specifically. Security Operations Security operations involves the monitoring of, and fast response to, security threats. Aware that cyber criminals could act at any time, security operations professionals must work consistently to notice attempts at attack or potential breaches. Identity and Access Management To protect data effectively, access to data must first be controlled. Giving people access only to what they need access to, and only when they need it is crucial in cyber security. Access management roles keep data secure by ensuring access is only granted where needed. All roles within physical cyber security will require certain qualifications, though also very important to these careers is an eagerness to learn. Other qualities of being able to work alone and as part of a team, trustworthiness and attention to detail will be useful in any physical cyber security role.
