News Week of 19th August 2025 . Rapidly emerging vulnerabilities show why businesses can’t afford to fall behind on security. This week has once again highlighted how quickly the cyber threat landscape is shifting. Attackers are exploiting newly discovered flaws in widely used software and developing advanced techniques to bypass defences. Even a single unpatched system can provide the entry point for data theft, service disruption, or complete compromise. The message is clear: don’t wait for an attack to happen. Proactive security updates and regular monitoring are essential to protecting your business. Here’s a look at some of the stories in cybersecurity this week: Microsoft Patch Tuesday Fixes Critical Outlook and Exchange Flaws Microsoft’s August Patch Tuesday delivered urgent fixes, including two critical vulnerabilities in Outlook and Exchange . One flaw could allow attackers to trigger malicious code simply by sending a specially crafted email – no user interaction required. Organisations using Microsoft 365 or on-prem Exchange should prioritise patching, as criminals are known to weaponise these flaws quickly once details are public. UK Financial Sector Targeted in New Phishing Campaign The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has issued a warning over a new wave of phishing emails targeting UK banks and their customers . Attackers are sending convincing emails that appear to come from legitimate financial institutions, tricking users into handing over login details. Businesses in financial services are urged to increase employee awareness training and enable multi-factor authentication wherever possible. Cisco Issues Warning on VPN Exploit Cisco has confirmed that attackers are actively exploiting a new vulnerability in its Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) VPNs . These devices are widely used in UK businesses to support hybrid working. Unpatched, these devices could give attackers remote access to sensitive corporate networks. Patching should be treated as a top priority. Ransomware Campaigns Hit UK Education and Healthcare The NCSC has reported a recent rise in ransomware attacks against UK schools, universities, and healthcare providers . These sectors are often targeted because they hold sensitive personal data but may lack the resources for advanced cyber security measures. Criminal groups are exploiting weak remote access and unpatched systems to lock down networks and demand payment. For organisations in these sectors, robust backup strategies, strong access controls, and regular security testing are essential to minimise risk. AI-Powered Cyber Attacks on the Rise New research highlights how attackers are leveraging AI to create more sophisticated phishing campaigns . Emails and chat messages generated with AI are increasingly harder to distinguish from legitimate communications. For businesses, this means security awareness training needs to evolve – staff must be prepared to spot subtle red flags rather than rely on poor grammar or tone as giveaways. Insider Threats and User Monitoring External attacks grab the headlines, but insider threats remain a significant risk. Employees, contractors, or compromised accounts can unintentionally or deliberately jeopardise sensitive data. Monitoring user activity, enforcing least-privilege access, and detecting anomalies can help identify suspicious behaviour early – before it escalates into a breach. Organisations should combine internal and external monitoring for full coverage. What This Means for Your Business The pace of change is clear: attackers are innovating quickly, and even the best defences can fall short without regular updates and ongoing vigilance. Organisations should: Patch critical vulnerabilities immediately (particularly Microsoft and Cisco products). Reinforce phishing defences with training and MFA. Review incident response plans to ensure readiness for fast-moving threats. Monitor user activity to detect anomalies and potential insider threats. Enforce strict access controls and least-privilege policies. Stay informed with trusted updates from the NCSC and security partners. At CyberCrowd, our mission is to help you stay ahead – whether it’s monitoring threats through our Managed SOC , conducting penetration testing to expose weaknesses, or supporting your team with expert cyber leadership. Wherever you are on your cyber security journey, we’re here to focus your efforts and help you avoid costly mistakes. Want to discuss how to strengthen your defences? Get in touch with us today.

Monitoring user activity, enforcing least-privilege access, and detecting anomalies can help identify suspicious behaviour early – before it escalates into a breach. Organisations should combine internal and external monitoring for full coverage. What This Means for Your Business The pace of change is clear: attackers are innovating quickly, and even the best defences can fall short without regular updates and ongoing vigilance. Organisations should: Patch critical vulnerabilities immediately (particularly Microsoft and Cisco products). Reinforce phishing defences with training and MFA. Review incident response plans to ensure readiness for fast-moving threats. Monitor user activity to detect anomalies and potential insider threats. Enforce strict access controls and least-privilege policies. Stay informed with trusted updates from the NCSC and security partners. At CyberCrowd, our mission is to help you stay ahead – whether it’s monitoring threats through our Managed SOC , conducting penetration testing to expose weaknesses, or supporting your team with expert cyber leadership. Wherever you are on your cyber security journey, we’re here to focus your efforts and help you avoid costly mistakes. Want to discuss how to strengthen your defences? Get in touch with us today.

Rapidly emerging vulnerabilities show why businesses can’t afford to fall behind on security. This week has once again highlighted how quickly the cyber threat landscape is shifting. Attackers are exploiting newly discovered flaws in widely used software and developing advanced techniques to bypass defences. Even a single unpatched system can provide the entry point for data theft, service disruption, or complete compromise. The message is clear: don’t wait for an attack to happen. Proactive security updates and regular monitoring are essential to protecting your business. Here’s a look at some of the stories in cybersecurity this week: Microsoft Patch Tuesday Fixes Critical Outlook and Exchange Flaws Microsoft’s August Patch Tuesday delivered urgent fixes, including two critical vulnerabilities in Outlook and Exchange . One flaw could allow attackers to trigger malicious code simply by sending a specially crafted email – no user interaction required. Organisations using Microsoft 365 or on-prem Exchange should prioritise patching, as criminals are known to weaponise these flaws quickly once details are public. UK Financial Sector Targeted in New Phishing Campaign The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has issued a warning over a new wave of phishing emails targeting UK banks and their customers . Attackers are sending convincing emails that appear to come from legitimate financial institutions, tricking users into handing over login details. Businesses in financial services are urged to increase employee awareness training and enable multi-factor authentication wherever possible. Cisco Issues Warning on VPN Exploit Cisco has confirmed that attackers are actively exploiting a new vulnerability in its Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) VPNs . These devices are widely used in UK businesses to support hybrid working. Unpatched, these devices could give attackers remote access to sensitive corporate networks. Patching should be treated as a top priority. Ransomware Campaigns Hit UK Education and Healthcare The NCSC has reported a recent rise in ransomware attacks against UK schools, universities, and healthcare providers . These sectors are often targeted because they hold sensitive personal data but may lack the resources for advanced cyber security measures. Criminal groups are exploiting weak remote access and unpatched systems to lock down networks and demand payment. For organisations in these sectors, robust backup strategies, strong access controls, and regular security testing are essential to minimise risk. AI-Powered Cyber Attacks on the Rise New research highlights how attackers are leveraging AI to create more sophisticated phishing campaigns . Emails and chat messages generated with AI are increasingly harder to distinguish from legitimate communications. For businesses, this means security awareness training needs to evolve – staff must be prepared to spot subtle red flags rather than rely on poor grammar or tone as giveaways. Insider Threats and User Monitoring External attacks grab the headlines, but insider threats remain a significant risk. Employees, contractors, or compromised accounts can unintentionally or deliberately jeopardise sensitive data.
