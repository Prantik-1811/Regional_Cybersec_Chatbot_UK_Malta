News In a world increasingly shaped by data, every organisation – regardless of size or sector – must ask itself a critical question: where does data protection sit within our business? Is it parked in IT? Owned by legal? Tacked onto compliance? Or perhaps loosely shared across departments, without a clear home? The truth is data protection isn’t just a tick-box requirement or a single department’s responsibility. It’s a fundamental part of how organisations govern their business – and how they earn and retain the trust of their customers, employees, and partners. Why Data Protection Matters More Than Ever Under UK law, data protection is governed by the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 . These frameworks define how personal data must be handled – and make clear the obligations organisations have around transparency, security, and accountability. But legislation aside, data protection is about respect . Respecting individuals’ rights. Respecting the sensitivity of the data they entrust to you. And respecting the risks to your organisation if that trust is broken. We’ve seen high-profile breaches in recent years involving everything from ransomware attacks on local councils to unlawful data sharing by commercial firms. These incidents not only bring fines and reputational damage – they also highlight a deeper problem: many organisations simply don’t have a clear, organisation-wide understanding of how data is collected, used, stored, or protected. What Does Data Protection Actually Cover? It’s easy to think of data protection as purely a compliance task. But in reality, it reaches into almost every corner of your business, including: HR processes (e.g., handling employee data and subject access requests) Marketing campaigns (consent, lawful basis, cookies, profiling) IT systems and data architecture Customer services (handling queries, complaints, and breach notifications) Supply chains and third-party processors Innovation and digital transformation projects If you’re not actively considering data protection at every level – especially when rolling out new systems or launching new services – you’re putting your organisation at risk. What If Something Goes Wrong? Let’s walk through a couple of scenarios. Scenario 1: Lost HR Spreadsheet with Employee Data Your HR team exports a spreadsheet of current employee details – including names, addresses, salaries, and National Insurance numbers – to work on performance review planning. The file is saved locally on a laptop rather than a secure drive. That laptop is later stolen from a train. Now what? Is this considered a personal data breach? Do staff know the first step – and who to notify? Is there an incident response process to follow? Can you assess the risk to individuals – and determine whether to report it to the ICO? Do you know how to contact and inform affected employees clearly and quickly? Was encryption in place? If not, why was sensitive data handled in this way? Even internal, day-to-day activities like HR data handling carry significant data protection risks. Without clear processes, awareness, and appropriate technical controls in place, a simple oversight can escalate into a major issue – both in terms of legal responsibility and employee trust. Scenario 2: Supplier Misuse of System Access Your organisation works with a third-party IT support provider who helps manage your internal systems. As part of their service agreement, they’re given admin-level access to a cloud-based database that stores client contact information and case notes. One day, a staff member notices unusual activity – several records were exported overnight, and an unfamiliar IP address accessed the system. Upon investigation, it turns out the supplier had recently onboarded a new employee who used the shared admin login to access data they weren’t authorised to see or extract. Now what? Was a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) in place with the supplier, clearly outlining their responsibilities and access controls? Do you log and monitor supplier access in real time? Were there audit trails or alerts in place to detect unusual activity earlier? Have you assessed whether this counts as a reportable breach under UK GDPR? What due diligence was done when access was granted – and has access now been revoked? Are your supplier vetting, onboarding and offboarding processes robust? This kind of incident highlights how data protection isn’t just about your internal staff – it extends to the entire chain of responsibility , including third parties. Even trusted partners must be properly managed, monitored and contractually bound to follow your data protection protocols. The Importance of Accountability and Visibility The ICO’s Accountability Framework provides a helpful structure to assess how well your organisation is managing data protection. A Gap Analysis against this framework allows you to identify what’s in place, what’s missing, and where the risks lie. It also offers something often overlooked: visibility . Having a framework in place helps you track your compliance journey. It allows leadership and boards to see the progress being made. And it highlights where contribution is needed – from IT, HR, Marketing, Operations, and beyond. After all, each department knows best what data they handle and what systems they rely on. Collaboration across departments also surfaces new opportunities: Are we launching a new customer portal? Introducing AI tools? Exploring automated decision-making? These projects must all pass through the lens of data protection – from planning through to delivery. Training & Culture: Your Front Line Defence Technology and policies are important, but people are your first line of defence. Running a tabletop exercise that simulates a data breach is a simple yet powerful tool. It gets teams talking, thinking, and understanding their roles in a crisis. It also reveals gaps in process and communication that might otherwise go unnoticed. Regular data protection training isn’t just for compliance – it’s about building a culture where data is handled responsibly, proactively, and confidently. How We Can Help At CyberCrowd, our Data Protection Consultancy Services are designed to help you do just that: build real knowledge and confidence across your organisation.

Is it parked in IT? Owned by legal? Tacked onto compliance? Or perhaps loosely shared across departments, without a clear home? The truth is data protection isn’t just a tick-box requirement or a single department’s responsibility. It’s a fundamental part of how organisations govern their business – and how they earn and retain the trust of their customers, employees, and partners. Why Data Protection Matters More Than Ever Under UK law, data protection is governed by the UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 . These frameworks define how personal data must be handled – and make clear the obligations organisations have around transparency, security, and accountability. But legislation aside, data protection is about respect . Respecting individuals’ rights. Respecting the sensitivity of the data they entrust to you. And respecting the risks to your organisation if that trust is broken. We’ve seen high-profile breaches in recent years involving everything from ransomware attacks on local councils to unlawful data sharing by commercial firms. These incidents not only bring fines and reputational damage – they also highlight a deeper problem: many organisations simply don’t have a clear, organisation-wide understanding of how data is collected, used, stored, or protected. What Does Data Protection Actually Cover? It’s easy to think of data protection as purely a compliance task. But in reality, it reaches into almost every corner of your business, including: HR processes (e.g., handling employee data and subject access requests) Marketing campaigns (consent, lawful basis, cookies, profiling) IT systems and data architecture Customer services (handling queries, complaints, and breach notifications) Supply chains and third-party processors Innovation and digital transformation projects If you’re not actively considering data protection at every level – especially when rolling out new systems or launching new services – you’re putting your organisation at risk. What If Something Goes Wrong? Let’s walk through a couple of scenarios. Scenario 1: Lost HR Spreadsheet with Employee Data Your HR team exports a spreadsheet of current employee details – including names, addresses, salaries, and National Insurance numbers – to work on performance review planning. The file is saved locally on a laptop rather than a secure drive. That laptop is later stolen from a train. Now what? Is this considered a personal data breach? Do staff know the first step – and who to notify? Is there an incident response process to follow? Can you assess the risk to individuals – and determine whether to report it to the ICO? Do you know how to contact and inform affected employees clearly and quickly? Was encryption in place? If not, why was sensitive data handled in this way? Even internal, day-to-day activities like HR data handling carry significant data protection risks. Without clear processes, awareness, and appropriate technical controls in place, a simple oversight can escalate into a major issue – both in terms of legal responsibility and employee trust. Scenario 2: Supplier Misuse of System Access Your organisation works with a third-party IT support provider who helps manage your internal systems. As part of their service agreement, they’re given admin-level access to a cloud-based database that stores client contact information and case notes. One day, a staff member notices unusual activity – several records were exported overnight, and an unfamiliar IP address accessed the system. Upon investigation, it turns out the supplier had recently onboarded a new employee who used the shared admin login to access data they weren’t authorised to see or extract. Now what? Was a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) in place with the supplier, clearly outlining their responsibilities and access controls? Do you log and monitor supplier access in real time? Were there audit trails or alerts in place to detect unusual activity earlier? Have you assessed whether this counts as a reportable breach under UK GDPR? What due diligence was done when access was granted – and has access now been revoked? Are your supplier vetting, onboarding and offboarding processes robust? This kind of incident highlights how data protection isn’t just about your internal staff – it extends to the entire chain of responsibility , including third parties. Even trusted partners must be properly managed, monitored and contractually bound to follow your data protection protocols. The Importance of Accountability and Visibility The ICO’s Accountability Framework provides a helpful structure to assess how well your organisation is managing data protection. A Gap Analysis against this framework allows you to identify what’s in place, what’s missing, and where the risks lie. It also offers something often overlooked: visibility . Having a framework in place helps you track your compliance journey. It allows leadership and boards to see the progress being made. And it highlights where contribution is needed – from IT, HR, Marketing, Operations, and beyond. After all, each department knows best what data they handle and what systems they rely on. Collaboration across departments also surfaces new opportunities: Are we launching a new customer portal? Introducing AI tools? Exploring automated decision-making? These projects must all pass through the lens of data protection – from planning through to delivery. Training & Culture: Your Front Line Defence Technology and policies are important, but people are your first line of defence. Running a tabletop exercise that simulates a data breach is a simple yet powerful tool. It gets teams talking, thinking, and understanding their roles in a crisis. It also reveals gaps in process and communication that might otherwise go unnoticed. Regular data protection training isn’t just for compliance – it’s about building a culture where data is handled responsibly, proactively, and confidently. How We Can Help At CyberCrowd, our Data Protection Consultancy Services are designed to help you do just that: build real knowledge and confidence across your organisation.
