Home / Author: cyberdotuk / Page 8 This month is Cyber Security Awareness Month and this week is Security Serious . In honour of both, here are my top ten tips to improve your organisation’s security. Whether you’re big or small, cyber insecurity is a real issue that we all need to address. Security shouldn’t be about locking down all information or getting in the way of people working, but it should be proportionate, holistic and tailored to the needs, context and risk appetite of the organisation.

This meant that, instead of hiding the personal details of those on its recipient list, it included their full names and email addresses Read More Two-factor authentication I was recently asked to discuss Ashley Madison and the wider security impact on users (on Sky News) and when I mentioned two-factor authentication, the presenter asked me to explain what it is. This happens a lot when I recommend two-factor authentication and always serves as a reminder that those things which we in the information security industry think of as basic security are not particularly well known to the average computer-user.

If they don’t know what it is, you can be pretty sure they’re not using it. Read More I appeared on Sky News on Wednesday evening discussing the theft and dump of Ashley Madison data. As always, time on live television is a great experience but also extremely limited so I wanted to expand on some of my thoughts on the social, organisational and individual implications.

A former Security Advisor to Saudi Aramco talks about the attack that destroyed 35,000 of their computers .
