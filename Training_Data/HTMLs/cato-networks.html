At Reliance Cyber, our commitment to secure digital transformation drives every technology decision. As our business scales and our workforce becomes increasingly hybrid, we needed a solution that could unify access, security, and performance – without the complexity and overhead of managing multiple platforms. We chose Cato Networks as a strategic upgrade to a converged, cloud-native SASE platform. This case study outlines the benefits we’ve realised and how we successfully executed the migration. Why Cato Networks? A strategic fit for our future Cato’s platform offered a unified approach to networking and security, aligning perfectly with our long-term goals: Operational simplicity : One console for all services, reducing overhead and complexity Single-vendor SASE : Networking and security delivered through one integrated platform Global private backbone : High-performance connectivity across regions Built-in security stack : NGFW, SWG, IPS, CASB, and XDR—all natively embedded Zero Trust by design : Identity-aware access with continuous posture checks Benefits Realised Since adopting Cato Networks, Reliance Cyber has seen measurable improvements across security, operations, performance, and cost. The unified Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) model has enabled consistent policy enforcement across all traffic types, eliminating gaps we previously encountered with siloed platforms. Cato’s native XDR capabilities integrate seamlessly with our existing XDR service, enhancing the overall XDR functionality of the platform. Its automated remediation workflows have significantly reduced our mean time to detect and respond to threats, enhancing our overall security posture. Operationally, our teams now manage access, networking, and security through a single interface. This consolidation has streamlined workflows, reduced training requirements, and allowed policy changes to be implemented in minutes rather than hours. Performance has also improved markedly—Cato’s global private backbone optimises routing and avoids public internet congestion, resulting in faster, more reliable access to both cloud and on-prem applications. Additionally, WAN optimisation features have boosted throughput for latency-sensitive workloads. From a commercial standpoint, Cato’s pricing model has proven more scalable and cost-effective. Using a tiered and flexible licensing model, organisations can tailor bandwidth and service usage based on their needs. By consolidating services into a single platform, we’ve eliminated redundant licensing, reduced operational complexity and the associated overhead cost. Migration Strategy: Seamless and Transparent Our migration to Cato Networks was executed through a carefully phased approach, ensuring minimal disruption to users and stakeholders. We began by deploying Cato in parallel with our existing Zscaler setup, allowing us to validate performance and align policies before making the full transition. Thanks to zero-touch deployment and thoughtful planning, most users experienced no noticeable change during the switch. To support adoption, we implemented a robust change management plan that included stakeholder training and clear internal communications. This ensured that teams were informed, prepared, and confident in using the new platform from day one. The result was a smooth, transparent migration that maintained business continuity throughout. Positioned for Growth Cato’s architecture has positioned Reliance Cyber for long-term scalability and strategic alignment. With native integrations into cloud platforms like Azure and AWS, and seamless compatibility with identity providers, we’re well-equipped to support a cloud-first strategy. The platform’s ability to deliver secure, high-performance access from anywhere has empowered our hybrid workforce, ensuring productivity without compromising security. As our needs evolve, Cato’s modular service model allows us to scale features and capabilities as required, without the complexity of managing multiple vendors or platforms. This flexibility, combined with the operational and commercial efficiencies we’ve gained, ensures we’re ready to grow with agility and confidence. CONCLUSION “More than a technology upgrade…” Our transition to Cato Networks has been more than a technology upgrade — it’s been a strategic enabler for growth, agility, and resilience. By consolidating networking and security into a single, cloud-native platform, we’ve simplified operations, strengthened our security posture, and unlocked significant performance and cost efficiencies. The migration was seamless, with minimal disruption and strong stakeholder engagement, demonstrating the value of careful planning and execution. Cato’s architecture aligns perfectly with our future-facing goals, supporting a hybrid workforce, cloud-first strategy, and scalable service adoption. As we continue to evolve, we’re confident that Cato will remain a trusted partner in helping us deliver secure, high-performance access across our organisation. For any business seeking to modernise its network and security infrastructure, we strongly recommend Cato Networks as a foundation for transformation.

At Reliance Cyber, our commitment to secure digital transformation drives every technology decision. As our business scales and our workforce becomes increasingly hybrid, we needed a solution that could unify access, security, and performance – without the complexity and overhead of managing multiple platforms. We chose Cato Networks as a strategic upgrade to a converged, cloud-native SASE platform. This case study outlines the benefits we’ve realised and how we successfully executed the migration. Why Cato Networks? A strategic fit for our future Cato’s platform offered a unified approach to networking and security, aligning perfectly with our long-term goals: Operational simplicity : One console for all services, reducing overhead and complexity Single-vendor SASE : Networking and security delivered through one integrated platform Global private backbone : High-performance connectivity across regions Built-in security stack : NGFW, SWG, IPS, CASB, and XDR—all natively embedded Zero Trust by design : Identity-aware access with continuous posture checks Benefits Realised Since adopting Cato Networks, Reliance Cyber has seen measurable improvements across security, operations, performance, and cost. The unified Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) model has enabled consistent policy enforcement across all traffic types, eliminating gaps we previously encountered with siloed platforms. Cato’s native XDR capabilities integrate seamlessly with our existing XDR service, enhancing the overall XDR functionality of the platform. Its automated remediation workflows have significantly reduced our mean time to detect and respond to threats, enhancing our overall security posture. Operationally, our teams now manage access, networking, and security through a single interface. This consolidation has streamlined workflows, reduced training requirements, and allowed policy changes to be implemented in minutes rather than hours. Performance has also improved markedly—Cato’s global private backbone optimises routing and avoids public internet congestion, resulting in faster, more reliable access to both cloud and on-prem applications. Additionally, WAN optimisation features have boosted throughput for latency-sensitive workloads. From a commercial standpoint, Cato’s pricing model has proven more scalable and cost-effective. Using a tiered and flexible licensing model, organisations can tailor bandwidth and service usage based on their needs. By consolidating services into a single platform, we’ve eliminated redundant licensing, reduced operational complexity and the associated overhead cost. Migration Strategy: Seamless and Transparent Our migration to Cato Networks was executed through a carefully phased approach, ensuring minimal disruption to users and stakeholders. We began by deploying Cato in parallel with our existing Zscaler setup, allowing us to validate performance and align policies before making the full transition. Thanks to zero-touch deployment and thoughtful planning, most users experienced no noticeable change during the switch. To support adoption, we implemented a robust change management plan that included stakeholder training and clear internal communications. This ensured that teams were informed, prepared, and confident in using the new platform from day one. The result was a smooth, transparent migration that maintained business continuity throughout. Positioned for Growth Cato’s architecture has positioned Reliance Cyber for long-term scalability and strategic alignment. With native integrations into cloud platforms like Azure and AWS, and seamless compatibility with identity providers, we’re well-equipped to support a cloud-first strategy. The platform’s ability to deliver secure, high-performance access from anywhere has empowered our hybrid workforce, ensuring productivity without compromising security. As our needs evolve, Cato’s modular service model allows us to scale features and capabilities as required, without the complexity of managing multiple vendors or platforms. This flexibility, combined with the operational and commercial efficiencies we’ve gained, ensures we’re ready to grow with agility and confidence. CONCLUSION “More than a technology upgrade…” Our transition to Cato Networks has been more than a technology upgrade — it’s been a strategic enabler for growth, agility, and resilience. By consolidating networking and security into a single, cloud-native platform, we’ve simplified operations, strengthened our security posture, and unlocked significant performance and cost efficiencies.
