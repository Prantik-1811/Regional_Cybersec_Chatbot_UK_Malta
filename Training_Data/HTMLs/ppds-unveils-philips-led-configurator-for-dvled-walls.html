ChannelLife UK - Industry insider news for technology resellers United Kingdom Guides # cloud services # cybersecurity # distributors # microsoft # partner programmes Search # Digital Signage # DevOps # Partner Programmes PPDS unveils Philips LED Configurator for dvLED walls Fri, 6th Feb 2026 (Today) By Sofiah Nichole Salivio, News Editor PPDS has launched an online Philips LED Configurator, a tool that lets partners and customers design and specify Philips dvLED video wall projects and place orders with selected components included. PPDS unveiled the updated platform at ISE 2026 in Barcelona. It positions the configurator as an end-to-end option for planning dvLED installations, from initial design through to a bill of materials that can be managed as part of a wider project package. Design workflow The configurator covers PPDS' range of indoor and outdoor Philips dvLED panels. Users can set requirements such as display size, pixel pitch, brightness, and refresh rates. The system then generates an on-screen visualisation of the proposed build based on those selections. The tool is linked to a catalogue of third-party components used in LED wall projects, including brackets, mounts, control boxes, data cables, light sensors, and finishing kits. Customers can select these items during the design process rather than sourcing them separately. The approach targets a common challenge in LED wall deployments: panels are often specified early, while practical items such as mounting hardware and cable routing are finalised later. These elements can affect feasibility and appearance, particularly when the display structure remains visible. PPDS said it worked with "leading manufacturers" across the AV component ecosystem, but did not name specific suppliers. The aim is to offer an optional package that reduces uncertainty regarding compatibility between panels, mounting systems, and control equipment. Components included By including peripheral items in the same interface, the configurator provides a fuller picture of what a finished installation might look like. PPDS said the results page shows the selected components alongside the dvLED panel configuration, allowing users to review design and specification choices before placing a final order. This may be particularly relevant for projects where physical constraints shape the build. A design that appears achievable based on panel dimensions alone can become more complex once control boxes, cable runs, and brackets are added. PPDS argues that earlier visibility of these factors reduces rework later. Project management The configurator is available globally and can be tailored for different markets, partners, and customers. It also provides a total cost for selected components, which can be managed within a broader project scope alongside other installation and integration activities. A standard version will also be available through the PPDS website and open to all users. PPDS said it will review enquiries and submissions and refer them to an appropriate specialist partner. The launch reflects a wider shift in professional AV towards digital specification and configuration tools. LED walls involve many variables, including viewing distance, content formats, environmental conditions, and installation constraints. Integrators and end customers have also faced long lead times and fluctuating component availability, increasing the value of standardised, repeatable project-planning workflows. Marco Van Der Knaap, Head of Strategy and Transformation Philips dvLED at PPDS, said the tool was designed to address practical challenges for installers and specifiers. "The journey from creation to installation of LED walls can sometimes be a complex, and frustrating, experience, with many aspects to consider. Having worked in this space for over 25 years, I have seen and experienced them all, and these provided the foundations for the new Philips LED Configurator. We have designed the platform to be easy to use and virtually foolproof, with the intuitive menus making the entire process - from selection to design - universally usable." PPDS also framed the configurator as a way for customers to test design ideas before entering a procurement cycle. Jae O Choi Park, EMEA Commercial Head at PPDS, said the platform lets users explore options before moving into more detailed discussions if they choose to proceed. "The new platform provides a fast and simple opportunity for customers to take control of their ambitions, to experiment with ideas, and then, should they wish, to take things to the next stage with formal and detailed discussions around the project. With our certified and trusted select partner network, the customer will be safe in the knowledge that, should they wish to proceed, they will be partnering with the best in the business based on their project needs. It's a win-win for everyone involved, ensuring the most positive outcomes and experiences." Van der Knaap added that PPDS built the system to show the full installation, including elements that can change both aesthetics and practicality. "With the Philips LED Configurator, you can create your complete solution in a single location and then visualise it perfectly on screen. That's not always been the case on other platforms. Things like cables, control boxes, and mounts will change the aesthetics of a project design and, in some cases, make the final results look untidy, if not completely unfeasible. We took all these concerns for installers into account while creating a unified solution that delivers exactly on what it promises. Providing everything required for planning an installation, ensuring project ambitions are much faster and as hassle free as possible. This is a game changing new tool for our partners and customers, not only simplifying project creation and management but also in helping them win business they may otherwise not have been aware of."

Jae O Choi Park, EMEA Commercial Head at PPDS, said the platform lets users explore options before moving into more detailed discussions if they choose to proceed. "The new platform provides a fast and simple opportunity for customers to take control of their ambitions, to experiment with ideas, and then, should they wish, to take things to the next stage with formal and detailed discussions around the project. With our certified and trusted select partner network, the customer will be safe in the knowledge that, should they wish to proceed, they will be partnering with the best in the business based on their project needs. It's a win-win for everyone involved, ensuring the most positive outcomes and experiences." Van der Knaap added that PPDS built the system to show the full installation, including elements that can change both aesthetics and practicality.
