News We’ve all been warned about suspicious emails and dodgy text messages. But a phone call? Surely that’s safe – we’re talking to a real person, after all. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what makes vishing (short for voice phishing ) so effective – and so dangerous. What is Vishing? Vishing is a type of social engineering attack that happens over the phone. Just like phishing (email) or smishing (SMS), the goal is the same: to manipulate you into giving up sensitive information, money, or access. But with vishing, the scammer sounds trustworthy. They might use urgency, authority, or emotional manipulation to bypass your better judgment. And with caller ID spoofing, deepfake audio tools, and convincing scripts, these scammers are getting more sophisticated than ever. Common Types of Vishing Attacks Here are just a few examples of vishing scams seen across the UK: 1. Family Trouble Scam (Law Enforcement Impersonation) A caller claims to be from the police or legal authority, saying a loved one is in trouble and needs bail money urgently. You might be asked to transfer funds, give personal details, or meet someone in person. It’s emotional, high-pressure, and calculated to override your critical thinking. 2. Tech Support Scam A scammer pretends to be from Microsoft, your internet provider, or even your IT department. They say your device has a virus or issue and guide you to install software (usually remote access tools). Suddenly, they’re in your system – and so is malware or ransomware. 3. UK Government or HMRC Scam The caller claims to be from HMRC or another government agency. You’re told you owe tax, are due a refund, or face legal action unless you act quickly. These scams prey on fear and authority. 4. Bank or Payment Fraud Scam You receive a call claiming to be from your bank’s fraud team, warning of suspicious activity. They’ll ask for account details, PINs, or ask you to move money to a “safe account.” Often, the number looks like it really is from your bank. 5. Job or Benefit Scam Especially during economic uncertainty, scammers may offer fake jobs, grants, or benefits. They’ll ask for upfront fees, banking info, or personal ID documents under the guise of onboarding. Why is Vishing So Effective? Because it feels real. You hear a voice. There’s urgency. You’re caught off-guard. Scammers often use psychological tricks like: Authority (“This is HMRC…”) Urgency (“You must act immediately or face legal consequences.”) Empathy (“We’re trying to help you recover your funds.”) Fear (“Your account has been compromised!”) And now, thanks to AI-powered voice cloning, it’s even possible to mimic the voice of someone you know – a rising threat that’s already been exploited in business scams. Real-World Vishing: Red Teaming in Action At CyberCrowd, we don’t just talk about these threats – we test them in real-world scenarios through Red Team engagements . In one recent project, vishing played a pivotal role in gaining access to restricted areas and sensitive systems – all through a single, well-crafted phone call. This exercise was part of a broader physical penetration test designed to assess organisational vulnerabilities beyond the digital perimeter. It’s a powerful example of how social engineering, when used strategically, can bypass even the most secure systems. Read the full case study: Inside the Action – A Red Team Physical Penetration Test in Action These real-life scenarios highlight why employee awareness and proactive testing are essential components of a strong cyber defence. Caller ID Spoofing and AI: The Game Has Changed One of the most alarming developments is the rise of caller ID spoofing and AI voice cloning . Fraudsters can now make a phone call appear to come from your bank, local police, or even a friend. The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has highlighted the growing use of AI in social engineering – not just to create deepfakes, but to craft persuasive scripts and clone voices from audio samples. If you’ve posted a video or voice note online, you could unknowingly become a target. How to Protect Yourself: A Quick Vishing Defence Guide 1. Go Slow Scammers create pressure. Take a breath. End the call and verify independently. 2. Be Suspicious of Unsolicited Calls If you’re not expecting the call, question it – even if the number looks legitimate. 3. Never Share Personal Information Your bank or government agency will never ask for PINs, passwords, or to move money. 4. Don’t Trust Callback Numbers Fraudsters will give fake callback numbers. Always find the official number yourself and call back independently. 5. Use Multi-Factor Authentication If your login is compromised, MFA can act as an extra barrier to entry. 6. Report It If you’ve been caught out – don’t feel embarrassed. These attacks are designed to trick you. Reporting helps protect others: Report to Action Fraud (the UK’s national fraud reporting centre) Let your bank or IT department know immediately Inform friends or colleagues to raise awareness Final Thoughts: Trust Your Gut – But Verify A phone call that catches you off guard can feel real, especially when a scammer knows just enough to make it sound convincing. But as vishing continues to evolve, we all need to build in a pause and ask: “Could this be a scam?” If it feels off – hang up. Verify. Ask questions. And encourage those around you to do the same, especially older family members or less tech-savvy colleagues who might be more vulnerable.

Common Types of Vishing Attacks Here are just a few examples of vishing scams seen across the UK: 1. Family Trouble Scam (Law Enforcement Impersonation) A caller claims to be from the police or legal authority, saying a loved one is in trouble and needs bail money urgently. You might be asked to transfer funds, give personal details, or meet someone in person. It’s emotional, high-pressure, and calculated to override your critical thinking. 2. Tech Support Scam A scammer pretends to be from Microsoft, your internet provider, or even your IT department. They say your device has a virus or issue and guide you to install software (usually remote access tools). Suddenly, they’re in your system – and so is malware or ransomware. 3. UK Government or HMRC Scam The caller claims to be from HMRC or another government agency. You’re told you owe tax, are due a refund, or face legal action unless you act quickly. These scams prey on fear and authority. 4. Bank or Payment Fraud Scam You receive a call claiming to be from your bank’s fraud team, warning of suspicious activity. They’ll ask for account details, PINs, or ask you to move money to a “safe account.” Often, the number looks like it really is from your bank. 5. Job or Benefit Scam Especially during economic uncertainty, scammers may offer fake jobs, grants, or benefits. They’ll ask for upfront fees, banking info, or personal ID documents under the guise of onboarding. Why is Vishing So Effective? Because it feels real. You hear a voice. There’s urgency. You’re caught off-guard. Scammers often use psychological tricks like: Authority (“This is HMRC…”) Urgency (“You must act immediately or face legal consequences.”) Empathy (“We’re trying to help you recover your funds.”) Fear (“Your account has been compromised!”) And now, thanks to AI-powered voice cloning, it’s even possible to mimic the voice of someone you know – a rising threat that’s already been exploited in business scams. Real-World Vishing: Red Teaming in Action At CyberCrowd, we don’t just talk about these threats – we test them in real-world scenarios through Red Team engagements . In one recent project, vishing played a pivotal role in gaining access to restricted areas and sensitive systems – all through a single, well-crafted phone call. This exercise was part of a broader physical penetration test designed to assess organisational vulnerabilities beyond the digital perimeter. It’s a powerful example of how social engineering, when used strategically, can bypass even the most secure systems. Read the full case study: Inside the Action – A Red Team Physical Penetration Test in Action These real-life scenarios highlight why employee awareness and proactive testing are essential components of a strong cyber defence. Caller ID Spoofing and AI: The Game Has Changed One of the most alarming developments is the rise of caller ID spoofing and AI voice cloning . Fraudsters can now make a phone call appear to come from your bank, local police, or even a friend. The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has highlighted the growing use of AI in social engineering – not just to create deepfakes, but to craft persuasive scripts and clone voices from audio samples. If you’ve posted a video or voice note online, you could unknowingly become a target. How to Protect Yourself: A Quick Vishing Defence Guide 1. Go Slow Scammers create pressure. Take a breath. End the call and verify independently. 2. Be Suspicious of Unsolicited Calls If you’re not expecting the call, question it – even if the number looks legitimate. 3. Never Share Personal Information Your bank or government agency will never ask for PINs, passwords, or to move money. 4. Don’t Trust Callback Numbers Fraudsters will give fake callback numbers. Always find the official number yourself and call back independently. 5. Use Multi-Factor Authentication If your login is compromised, MFA can act as an extra barrier to entry. 6. Report It If you’ve been caught out – don’t feel embarrassed. These attacks are designed to trick you. Reporting helps protect others: Report to Action Fraud (the UK’s national fraud reporting centre) Let your bank or IT department know immediately Inform friends or colleagues to raise awareness Final Thoughts: Trust Your Gut – But Verify A phone call that catches you off guard can feel real, especially when a scammer knows just enough to make it sound convincing. But as vishing continues to evolve, we all need to build in a pause and ask: “Could this be a scam?” If it feels off – hang up. Verify. Ask questions. And encourage those around you to do the same, especially older family members or less tech-savvy colleagues who might be more vulnerable.

Surely that’s safe – we’re talking to a real person, after all. Unfortunately, that’s exactly what makes vishing (short for voice phishing ) so effective – and so dangerous. What is Vishing? Vishing is a type of social engineering attack that happens over the phone.
