News Here’s your fresh weekly round-up of some of the most impactful cybersecurity developments for organisations looking to stay ahead: 1. NCSC and Allies Pin Cyber Campaigns on Three Chinese Tech Firms The UK’s NCSC, in collaboration with international partners, has publicly linked three Chinese technology companies to a widespread cyberattack targeting critical global networks. The advisory emphasizes that many exploited vulnerabilities are already known – and patchable. This is a crucial wake-up call for UK entities reliant on international tech vendors to ensure they’re up to date. Thought: This underscores the importance of maintaining strong supply chain visibility and patching discipline. If vulnerabilities are public and fixable, delaying updates is no longer defensible. 2. UK Government Under Fire Over Delayed Public Sector Data Breach Review A long-awaited review into 11 major UK public sector data breaches was released belatedly after sustained pressure. It found significant control failures – such as misdirected emails and unredacted spreadsheets – and only 12 of 14 recommendations have been implemented so far. Thought: Timeliness matters in cybersecurity – not just in detection and response, but also in learning and acting on lessons. Enterprises and public bodies alike must prioritise transparent post-incident reviews and fast-tracked remediation. 3. Cyber Experts Say Accountability Begins at the Board Level According to a CIISec report, 91% of cyber security professionals believe boards – not CISOs – should bear ultimate responsibility for cyber resilience. Over half recommend penalties for senior management in case of major failures. The sentiment is growing, especially with emerging regulations like NIS2 and DORA demanding stronger governance. Thought: Cyber risk is now enterprise risk. Boards must shift from oversight to ownership – understanding threats, breaking budget silos, and advocating for the right security posture. 4. Citrix NetScaler Devices Still Exposed Despite Patches Thousands of Citrix NetScaler appliances remain vulnerable even after patches were released this week – including to an exploit already being weaponised. Thought: Patch availability doesn’t equate to system immunity. Organisations must validate patch deployment and monitoring effectiveness – especially when fixes address critical, active threats. CyberCrowd Insight Cyber threats aren’t slowing down, and the headlines this week show a familiar theme: patching delays, governance gaps, and accountability challenges. At CyberCrowd, we help organisations strengthen their defences across the entire cyber resilience lifecycle – from penetration testing and managed detection, through to board-level strategy and incident response. If these stories raise questions about your own organisation’s resilience, we’d be glad to talk.
