SecurityBrief UK - Technology news for CISOs & cybersecurity decision-makers United Kingdom Guides # cloud security # cybersecurity # endpoint protection # firewalls # ransomware Search # Manufacturing # Data Analytics # Digital Transformation Celonis names CyberArk chief Matt Cohen to its board Fri, 6th Feb 2026 (Today) By Sofiah Nichole Salivio, News Editor Celonis has appointed Matt Cohen, CEO of CyberArk, to its Board of Directors as it expands its Process Intelligence business and positions its software for enterprise AI use cases. Cohen has led CyberArk since 2023. He joined the identity security company in 2019 as Chief Revenue Officer, later serving as Chief Operating Officer before becoming CEO. Celonis said he brings experience scaling large software platforms and managing global change programmes. During Cohen's tenure, CyberArk has moved toward a platform approach and expanded its international footprint. Before CyberArk, Cohen spent 18 years at industrial software group PTC in senior roles, including Executive Vice President of Worldwide Field Operations. Celonis credited him with helping grow PTC to more than USD $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. Such board appointments are common in the sector, particularly among late-stage private companies and public groups seeking additional operational experience and external perspective. Celonis has been sharpening its positioning around "process intelligence", which it markets as a bridge between enterprise data and day-to-day operations. Platform focus Celonis sells a Process Intelligence Platform that draws data from corporate systems and applications and can also connect to devices. Celonis said the platform adds business context and creates a "living digital twin of operations". The product is designed to map and analyse how work actually moves through an organisation. Celonis said it can also be used to design and run AI-enabled processes. The company ties its strategy to "composable enterprise" approaches, which emphasise modular software components that can be changed and recombined as business needs shift. For technology suppliers, this messaging reflects a broader shift in how large organisations buy and deploy software. Many companies have expanded their application estates over the past decade, leaving fragmented data and complex process handoffs. Vendors in process mining, automation, and observability argue that better operational visibility is a prerequisite for safe, measurable AI deployments. Celonis has made a similar case in its sales narrative, describing its platform as a way to move beyond pilot projects and connect AI to operational decisions. Cohen's background in identity security also adds perspective from a segment of enterprise software closely tied to AI governance and access control. Executive views Alex Rinke, Co-CEO and Co-Founder of Celonis, linked the appointment to the company's ambitions in the enterprise software market. "Matt knows what it takes to build a world-class enterprise platform," Rinke said. "His experience in navigating complex global transformations will be a massive asset as we help our customers move beyond AI experiments to real business results." Cohen said Celonis aligns with corporate priorities around operational visibility and returns on AI spending. "Celonis sits at the intersection of two defining enterprise trends: the need for operational intelligence and the imperative to deliver real value from AI investments," Cohen said. "I've spent my career helping companies grow through transformation, and I see tremendous opportunity ahead for Celonis. I'm thrilled to join the board at this pivotal moment in the company's growth." Competitive landscape Celonis competes in a market that spans process mining specialists and larger enterprise software groups that have added process analysis features to broader suites. The category also includes automation providers and analytics platforms that promote end-to-end monitoring across systems. Buyers often evaluate these tools alongside workflow automation, data integration, and business intelligence products. This puts pressure on vendors to demonstrate measurable outcomes such as shorter cycle times, fewer exceptions, and improved compliance, while meeting expectations for tighter integration with enterprise applications. Celonis said its platform connects to multiple systems and uses contextual information to present an operational view, which it positions as a key differentiator. Board experience in platform transitions has become increasingly valued as software firms work to standardise offerings and reduce customer complexity. Celonis said Cohen oversaw a platform shift at CyberArk, experience that may be relevant as Celonis develops packaging and partner strategies for AI-related use cases across finance, supply chain, and customer operations. Celonis did not disclose any other changes to its board. Cohen joins as the company continues to market its platform around AI-driven process design and operational monitoring.
