Reject All Save My Preferences Accept All Powered by Reject All Save My Preferences Accept All News & Events Supporting Customers’ Strategic Goals With Enhanced Cyber Security Services Reliance Cyber - 16 February 2023 Estimated reading time: 4 minutes Reliance Cyber, a leading mid-market pure-play cybersecurity provider, has announced the launch of its latest round of new service features, designed to support customers with their ongoing cyber security and strategic goals. The changes are in line with the organisation’s continued expansion as one of the go-to security providers for the mid-market. CTO Luke Hull said “As an organisation, we are continuously improving, part of this ongoing commitment has seen us working hard to provide enhanced managed security services (MSS) as well as customer experience to both our channel partners and end clients. As such, we are delighted to announce the introduction of our next generation of Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) functionality. This new functionality sees us leveraging game-changing technology like Artificial Intelligence, to underpin and support our services”. So what’s new? Amongst other things, the new features include automated workflows, a more intuitive user interface for our client portal, enhanced search capability, and a personalised help centre. These are just some of the additions that channel partners and customers will benefit from. What do the changes mean for our customers? Reliance Cyber has always provided industry-leading cyber security services to the mid-market, however, the latest additions to their arsenal again see the organisation adopt technology and practices mostly utilised by the larger security players, many of whom predominantly focus on, or serve clients that sit outside of the mid-market. The latest enhancements include: Artificial Intelligence – making it easier than ever to quickly identify, investigate, and respond to security threats. Automated workflows – Reducing manual effort and enabling faster and more accurate response times. Improved analytics and reporting capabilities – Providing deeper insights into security trends and threats. All of these elements mean an even more heightened service for Reliance Cyber customers. How will our channel partners benefit from the new updates? Our channel partners will now have a view of multiple dashboards across the estates we manage, giving them enhanced visibility and ease of access to key information. Having all of this information in a digestible format means our partners can serve their end clients more effectively. The self-service element also increases efficiency, meaning that our partners no longer need to spend time looking for or finding information, instead everything is to hand. The latest features include: A new intuitive user interface – making it easier to navigate our customer services portal and find the help you need. Enhanced search capability – allowing customers to search for specific topics or services quickly. A personalised help centre – enabling customers to ask questions and get the answers they need quickly and easily. Reliance Cyber Chief Customer Officer, James Dyson concluded by saying. “We are committed to providing our customers with the best customer service experience possible, and these new features are just the beginning. We look forward to hearing your feedback and continuously improving our customer services portal to make it even more user-friendly.” If you would like to know more about how Reliance Cyber can support your strategic goals with tailored security solutions, get in contact and speak to one of the team. About Reliance Cyber At Reliance Cyber, we believe in truly partnering with our customers. We work with organisations in many different sectors, to defend them against advanced cyber threats including up to nation-state-level. We develop a real, in-depth understanding of the risks an organisation faces and create bespoke solutions. Our industry-leading cyber security expertise and experience enable organisations to focus on the things that they do best.

We work with organisations in many different sectors, to defend them against advanced cyber threats including up to nation-state-level. We develop a real, in-depth understanding of the risks an organisation faces and create bespoke solutions. Our industry-leading cyber security expertise and experience enable organisations to focus on the things that they do best. Reliance Cyber, a leading mid-market pure-play cybersecurity provider, has announced the launch of its latest round of new service features, designed to support customers with their ongoing cyber security and strategic goals. The changes are in line with the organisation’s continued expansion as one of the go-to security providers for the mid-market. CTO Luke Hull said “As an organisation, we are continuously improving, part of this ongoing commitment has seen us working hard to provide enhanced managed security services (MSS) as well as customer experience to both our channel partners and end clients. As such, we are delighted to announce the introduction of our next generation of Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) functionality. This new functionality sees us leveraging game-changing technology like Artificial Intelligence, to underpin and support our services”. Amongst other things, the new features include automated workflows, a more intuitive user interface for our client portal, enhanced search capability, and a personalised help centre. These are just some of the additions that channel partners and customers will benefit from. What do the changes mean for our customers? Reliance Cyber has always provided industry-leading cyber security services to the mid-market, however, the latest additions to their arsenal again see the organisation adopt technology and practices mostly utilised by the larger security players, many of whom predominantly focus on, or serve clients that sit outside of the mid-market. The latest enhancements include: Artificial Intelligence – making it easier than ever to quickly identify, investigate, and respond to security threats. Automated workflows – Reducing manual effort and enabling faster and more accurate response times. Improved analytics and reporting capabilities – Providing deeper insights into security trends and threats. All of these elements mean an even more heightened service for Reliance Cyber customers. How will our channel partners benefit from the new updates? Our channel partners will now have a view of multiple dashboards across the estates we manage, giving them enhanced visibility and ease of access to key information. Having all of this information in a digestible format means our partners can serve their end clients more effectively. The self-service element also increases efficiency, meaning that our partners no longer need to spend time looking for or finding information, instead everything is to hand. The latest features include: A new intuitive user interface – making it easier to navigate our customer services portal and find the help you need. Enhanced search capability – allowing customers to search for specific topics or services quickly. A personalised help centre – enabling customers to ask questions and get the answers they need quickly and easily. Reliance Cyber Chief Customer Officer, James Dyson concluded by saying. “We are committed to providing our customers with the best customer service experience possible, and these new features are just the beginning. We look forward to hearing your feedback and continuously improving our customer services portal to make it even more user-friendly.” If you would like to know more about how Reliance Cyber can support your strategic goals with tailored security solutions, get in contact and speak to one of the team.
