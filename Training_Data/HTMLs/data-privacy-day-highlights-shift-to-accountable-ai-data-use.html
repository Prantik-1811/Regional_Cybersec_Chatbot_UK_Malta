Industry executives say businesses face rising expectations from regulators, partners and customers who want evidence of operational privacy controls rather than policy-level commitments. They point to stronger data governance, integrated compliance and standards-based frameworks as key trends shaping privacy strategies this year. Accountability focus Data Privacy Day, marked annually on 28 January, originated with the Council of Europe and highlights privacy and data protection across governments, businesses and individuals. Sam Peters, Chief Product Officer at compliance specialist IO, linked this year's official theme to a wider shift towards demonstrable accountability inside organisations. "This year's Data Privacy Day theme, "You have the power to take charge of your data," is ultimately about accountability. For organisations, that means proving data privacy is governed in practice, not just on paper. "Customers, partners and regulators now expect organisations to demonstrate how privacy is embedded into day-to-day operations. Policies alone are no longer enough. The real test is whether organisations can demonstrate strong information security foundations, clear ownership and consistent execution across people, technology and suppliers. "Similarly, a growing number of UK and US businesses now require GDPR compliance from their suppliers as a condition of doing business. Data privacy has become a commercial expectation, not simply a regulatory one. And organisations with weak privacy maturity are increasingly being exposed. "As we move through 2026, those gaps in privacy maturity will become harder to ignore. The introduction of changes under the UK's Data (Use and Access) Act will place renewed scrutiny on accountability. "Against this backdrop, effective data protection increasingly depends on strong information security foundations, clearly defined responsibilities and repeatable processes. This is why standards-based approaches are gaining traction. Frameworks such as ISO 27701 are being used to formalise privacy operations, helping organisations move from intent to execution by structuring data mapping, privacy-by-design and data subject rights management in line with evolving regulation. "Crucially, privacy cannot sit in isolation. Integrated compliance, aligning data protection, information security, and AI governance, is becoming essential. Organisations that take this joined-up approach are better positioned to manage risk, scale responsibly and adapt as regulatory and commercial expectations continue to rise. "On Data Privacy Day 2026, the message is clear. Taking charge of data means taking responsibility for how privacy works in practice - across the organisation and beyond," said Peters, Chief Product Officer, IO. Data governance Companies that deploy AI are facing questions about how they manage underlying data. Executives argue that privacy, security and AI oversight now converge on how organisations govern information across its lifecycle. "On Data Privacy Day, organizations should remember: you can't govern AI or protect privacy without governing data. Strong data governance turns principles into accountable practice. You build trust with your customers when you protect their data, and you can do the same with regulators when you demonstrate control and accountability. "AI brings new responsibilities: Protecting data from breaches is one thing, but you must also use data ethically in automated systems. How do you do this? "Fortunately, but not coincidentally, the governance practices that make you trustworthy on security are the same practices that make you trustworthy on AI. Trust stems from demonstrable responsibility in handling data, regardless of whether that data feeds a security monitoring system or a machine learning model," said Anthony Woodward, CEO, RecordPoint. Regulatory pressure Peters highlighted commercial and regulatory drivers that are forcing organisations to reassess privacy maturity. Supply chain expectations now often include contractual privacy requirements. The UK's evolving legislative framework is expected to put more weight on demonstrable controls and audit trails. Large customers increasingly ask suppliers for evidence of privacy controls. They may request structured information about incident response, data subject rights handling and vendor oversight. Organisations that cannot provide this information risk losing business. Peters pointed to formal standards such as ISO 27701 that organisations are adopting. These frameworks create a defined structure around data inventories, privacy-by-design processes and ongoing monitoring of compliance. Integrated approach Both executives describe a convergence between privacy, information security and AI governance. Organisations are starting to integrate these functions instead of treating them as separate silos. This integration often involves shared risk registers, unified control sets and coordinated audit programmes. Internal ownership models are changing. Many firms now distribute responsibility for privacy and data governance across technology, legal, compliance and business units. They record duties explicitly and connect them to recurring tasks, such as access reviews, data minimisation exercises and third-party assessments. The shift has implications for technology investment. Companies are aligning tools that handle security monitoring, data discovery, records management and AI model oversight. They are also revisiting training for staff who work with personal data or automated decision systems. Commercial expectations Executives say that privacy posture now influences market access and partner selection. Firms with documented, repeatable processes for managing personal data can respond more quickly to due diligence requests. They can also present clearer evidence of compliance to regulators. For many organisations, this work extends beyond legal minimums. It involves setting internal benchmarks that match or exceed customer expectations in key markets, including the UK, EU and US. "Crucially, privacy cannot sit in isolation. Integrated compliance, aligning data protection, information security, and AI governance, is becoming essential. Organisations that take this joined-up approach are better positioned to manage risk, scale responsibly and adapt as regulatory and commercial expectations continue to rise," said Peters.

Data Privacy Day is placing fresh attention on how organisations handle customer data, as advances in artificial intelligence and new regulation increase scrutiny of accountability and day-to-day practice. Industry executives say businesses face rising expectations from regulators, partners and customers who want evidence of operational privacy controls rather than policy-level commitments. They point to stronger data governance, integrated compliance and standards-based frameworks as key trends shaping privacy strategies this year. Data Privacy Day, marked annually on 28 January, originated with the Council of Europe and highlights privacy and data protection across governments, businesses and individuals. Sam Peters, Chief Product Officer at compliance specialist IO, linked this year's official theme to a wider shift towards demonstrable accountability inside organisations. "This year's Data Privacy Day theme, "You have the power to take charge of your data," is ultimately about accountability. For organisations, that means proving data privacy is governed in practice, not just on paper. "Customers, partners and regulators now expect organisations to demonstrate how privacy is embedded into day-to-day operations. Policies alone are no longer enough. The real test is whether organisations can demonstrate strong information security foundations, clear ownership and consistent execution across people, technology and suppliers. "Similarly, a growing number of UK and US businesses now require GDPR compliance from their suppliers as a condition of doing business. Data privacy has become a commercial expectation, not simply a regulatory one. And organisations with weak privacy maturity are increasingly being exposed. "As we move through 2026, those gaps in privacy maturity will become harder to ignore. The introduction of changes under the UK's Data (Use and Access) Act will place renewed scrutiny on accountability. "Against this backdrop, effective data protection increasingly depends on strong information security foundations, clearly defined responsibilities and repeatable processes. This is why standards-based approaches are gaining traction. Frameworks such as ISO 27701 are being used to formalise privacy operations, helping organisations move from intent to execution by structuring data mapping, privacy-by-design and data subject rights management in line with evolving regulation. "Crucially, privacy cannot sit in isolation. Integrated compliance, aligning data protection, information security, and AI governance, is becoming essential. Organisations that take this joined-up approach are better positioned to manage risk, scale responsibly and adapt as regulatory and commercial expectations continue to rise. "On Data Privacy Day 2026, the message is clear. Taking charge of data means taking responsibility for how privacy works in practice - across the organisation and beyond," said Peters, Chief Product Officer, IO. Companies that deploy AI are facing questions about how they manage underlying data. Executives argue that privacy, security and AI oversight now converge on how organisations govern information across its lifecycle. "AI brings new responsibilities: Protecting data from breaches is one thing, but you must also use data ethically in automated systems. How do you do this? "Fortunately, but not coincidentally, the governance practices that make you trustworthy on security are the same practices that make you trustworthy on AI. Trust stems from demonstrable responsibility in handling data, regardless of whether that data feeds a security monitoring system or a machine learning model," said Anthony Woodward, CEO, RecordPoint. Peters highlighted commercial and regulatory drivers that are forcing organisations to reassess privacy maturity. Supply chain expectations now often include contractual privacy requirements. The UK's evolving legislative framework is expected to put more weight on demonstrable controls and audit trails. Large customers increasingly ask suppliers for evidence of privacy controls. They may request structured information about incident response, data subject rights handling and vendor oversight. Organisations that cannot provide this information risk losing business. Peters pointed to formal standards such as ISO 27701 that organisations are adopting. These frameworks create a defined structure around data inventories, privacy-by-design processes and ongoing monitoring of compliance. Both executives describe a convergence between privacy, information security and AI governance. Organisations are starting to integrate these functions instead of treating them as separate silos. This integration often involves shared risk registers, unified control sets and coordinated audit programmes. Internal ownership models are changing. Many firms now distribute responsibility for privacy and data governance across technology, legal, compliance and business units. They record duties explicitly and connect them to recurring tasks, such as access reviews, data minimisation exercises and third-party assessments. The shift has implications for technology investment. Companies are aligning tools that handle security monitoring, data discovery, records management and AI model oversight. They are also revisiting training for staff who work with personal data or automated decision systems. Commercial expectations Executives say that privacy posture now influences market access and partner selection. Firms with documented, repeatable processes for managing personal data can respond more quickly to due diligence requests. They can also present clearer evidence of compliance to regulators. For many organisations, this work extends beyond legal minimums. It involves setting internal benchmarks that match or exceed customer expectations in key markets, including the UK, EU and US. "Crucially, privacy cannot sit in isolation. Integrated compliance, aligning data protection, information security, and AI governance, is becoming essential. Organisations that take this joined-up approach are better positioned to manage risk, scale responsibly and adapt as regulatory and commercial expectations continue to rise," said Peters.
