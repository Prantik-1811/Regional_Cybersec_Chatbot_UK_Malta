News October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month , and as we wrap up our Core 4 series (passwords, MFA, software updates…), it’s time for one of the trickiest but most vital topics: Recognising and Reporting Scams. Scammers are becoming increasingly sophisticated and creative, but with the right awareness, you can stay one step ahead. Being targeted by a scam doesn’t mean you were careless – it means you were chosen by someone running a calculated operation. The good news? You can outsmart them. As technology evolves (yes, even with AI in the mix), so do the tools and knowledge we have to protect ourselves. — How Scams Work: Manipulating Emotions & Pressure Scammers rely heavily on emotions , urgency , and lack of context . Here are classic signs: Sudden, urgent emotions – fear, panic, reward, shame “You won our sweepstakes – act now!” “You’re under arrest / overdue tax / hacked – pay immediately” “I’ve been recording you” Push you to click before thinking Unexpected link or button: “Click now,” “Verify immediately,” “Unlock your account” Requests for immediate payment or action Unexpected contact Unknown email, text, DM, or phone call Messages from a “friend” sounding odd or out-of-character Slow-burn or “wrong number” beginnings “Hey, how are you?” from a number you don’t recognise “Do you have dentist recs?” Seemingly benign conversation that escalates These are all symptoms of phishing and scam attempts – in email, text, DMs, and increasingly via AI-assisted calls or deepfake voices. — What to Do Immediately (Don’t Engage, Don’t Blame Yourself) Don’t click anything Not the link, not “unsubscribe,” nothing. Report as phishing (if possible) Many email services let you mark messages as phishing or spam. Delete Remove the message from your inbox / chat / phone. Block the contact Prevent further approach from that number / sender. Don’t respond to wrong numbers One new tactic is a casual “wrong number” text to start a rapport – don’t reply, block and report. It’s not rude; it’s safe. — Reporting: What You Should Do If You’ve Been Scammed or Suspect One For individuals: How to Report a Scam (UK) Suspicious emails: Forward them to report@phishing.gov.uk – this goes directly to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) . Suspicious text messages: Forward them free to 7726 – your mobile provider will investigate and block the sender if necessary. Fraud or cybercrime: Report through Action Fraud online or by calling 0300 123 2040 . Immediate threat or harm: If you believe there’s an ongoing risk, contact your local police . Bank or financial scams: Contact your bank immediately using the number on the back of your card, or call 159 – the secure “Stop Scams” helpline that connects you directly to your bank. If you receive a call claiming to be from your bank, hang up and dial 159 to verify it’s genuine. Keep evidence: Save messages, screenshots, call logs, and transaction records – these can support any investigation later. For businesses / workplace: If a Scam or Phishing Attempt Targets Your Business Report internally: Notify your IT, security, or incident response team immediately – don’t try to handle it alone. Log details: Record who received the message, when, what was requested, any links or attachments, and any responses given. Report externally: Report to Action Fraud (or your national cybercrime reporting centre). Forward phishing emails to report@phishing.gov.uk (NCSC). Assess impact: If there’s any sign of a data breach, financial loss, or compromised account, escalate through your incident response plan . Meet regulatory obligations: If personal data may be affected, review requirements under GDPR and notify the ICO (UK) if necessary. Alert staff: Inform your wider team so others recognise the scam and don’t fall victim to similar messages. Review and learn: Use the incident as a training opportunity – update phishing awareness, security policies, and procedures where needed. — The Role of AI, Deepfakes & Evolution of Scams Scams are getting more cunning thanks to AI. Voice cloning, phishing emails written in perfect tone, and deepfake video messages are being used to impersonate trusted individuals or organisations. That’s why context, caution, and verification are more important than ever. One trick: agree on a “safe word / safe phrase” with family, friends or colleagues. If a message or call claims to be from someone you know but they fail to use it, that’s a red flag. — You’re Not Alone – Don’t Be Ashamed Let’s be clear: falling victim to a scam doesn’t make you weak . Scammers are clever, persistent, and operate like businesses. Many people have been targeted – the important part is how we respond going forward. Reporting a scam doesn’t just help you – it helps others too. It’s how patterns get spotted, domains taken down, and future victims protected. — How This Matters for Businesses & Organisations Scams targeting businesses are often more targeted – spear phishing, whaling (senior-level impersonation), invoice fraud, fake vendor requests, etc. A single misguided click can lead to financial loss, reputational damage, or data breach. By educating staff, enforcing incident reporting procedures, and encouraging a culture of skepticism (without blame), organisations can drastically reduce risk. At CyberCrowd , we help businesses strengthen resilience through proactive monitoring, threat detection, and incident response so that when a scam attempt hits, you’re ready — not reactive.

From customer service bots to productivity assistants, organisations are racing to... 24 November 2025 News October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month , and as we wrap up our Core 4 series (passwords, MFA, software updates…), it’s time for one of the trickiest but most vital topics: Recognising and Reporting Scams. Scammers are becoming increasingly sophisticated and creative, but with the right awareness, you can stay one step ahead. Being targeted by a scam doesn’t mean you were careless – it means you were chosen by someone running a calculated operation. The good news? You can outsmart them. As technology evolves (yes, even with AI in the mix), so do the tools and knowledge we have to protect ourselves. — How Scams Work: Manipulating Emotions & Pressure Scammers rely heavily on emotions , urgency , and lack of context . Here are classic signs: Sudden, urgent emotions – fear, panic, reward, shame “You won our sweepstakes – act now!” “You’re under arrest / overdue tax / hacked – pay immediately” “I’ve been recording you” Push you to click before thinking Unexpected link or button: “Click now,” “Verify immediately,” “Unlock your account” Requests for immediate payment or action Unexpected contact Unknown email, text, DM, or phone call Messages from a “friend” sounding odd or out-of-character Slow-burn or “wrong number” beginnings “Hey, how are you?” from a number you don’t recognise “Do you have dentist recs?” Seemingly benign conversation that escalates These are all symptoms of phishing and scam attempts – in email, text, DMs, and increasingly via AI-assisted calls or deepfake voices. — What to Do Immediately (Don’t Engage, Don’t Blame Yourself) Don’t click anything Not the link, not “unsubscribe,” nothing. Report as phishing (if possible) Many email services let you mark messages as phishing or spam. Delete Remove the message from your inbox / chat / phone. Block the contact Prevent further approach from that number / sender. Don’t respond to wrong numbers One new tactic is a casual “wrong number” text to start a rapport – don’t reply, block and report. It’s not rude; it’s safe. — Reporting: What You Should Do If You’ve Been Scammed or Suspect One For individuals: How to Report a Scam (UK) Suspicious emails: Forward them to report@phishing.gov.uk – this goes directly to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) . Suspicious text messages: Forward them free to 7726 – your mobile provider will investigate and block the sender if necessary. Fraud or cybercrime: Report through Action Fraud online or by calling 0300 123 2040 . Immediate threat or harm: If you believe there’s an ongoing risk, contact your local police . Bank or financial scams: Contact your bank immediately using the number on the back of your card, or call 159 – the secure “Stop Scams” helpline that connects you directly to your bank. If you receive a call claiming to be from your bank, hang up and dial 159 to verify it’s genuine. Keep evidence: Save messages, screenshots, call logs, and transaction records – these can support any investigation later. For businesses / workplace: If a Scam or Phishing Attempt Targets Your Business Report internally: Notify your IT, security, or incident response team immediately – don’t try to handle it alone. Log details: Record who received the message, when, what was requested, any links or attachments, and any responses given. Report externally: Report to Action Fraud (or your national cybercrime reporting centre). Forward phishing emails to report@phishing.gov.uk (NCSC). Assess impact: If there’s any sign of a data breach, financial loss, or compromised account, escalate through your incident response plan . Meet regulatory obligations: If personal data may be affected, review requirements under GDPR and notify the ICO (UK) if necessary. Alert staff: Inform your wider team so others recognise the scam and don’t fall victim to similar messages. Review and learn: Use the incident as a training opportunity – update phishing awareness, security policies, and procedures where needed. — The Role of AI, Deepfakes & Evolution of Scams Scams are getting more cunning thanks to AI. Voice cloning, phishing emails written in perfect tone, and deepfake video messages are being used to impersonate trusted individuals or organisations. That’s why context, caution, and verification are more important than ever. One trick: agree on a “safe word / safe phrase” with family, friends or colleagues. If a message or call claims to be from someone you know but they fail to use it, that’s a red flag. — You’re Not Alone – Don’t Be Ashamed Let’s be clear: falling victim to a scam doesn’t make you weak . Scammers are clever, persistent, and operate like businesses. Many people have been targeted – the important part is how we respond going forward. Reporting a scam doesn’t just help you – it helps others too. It’s how patterns get spotted, domains taken down, and future victims protected. — How This Matters for Businesses & Organisations Scams targeting businesses are often more targeted – spear phishing, whaling (senior-level impersonation), invoice fraud, fake vendor requests, etc. A single misguided click can lead to financial loss, reputational damage, or data breach. By educating staff, enforcing incident reporting procedures, and encouraging a culture of skepticism (without blame), organisations can drastically reduce risk.
