Risk Assessment and Maturity Framework. We assess your organisation against combined international standards, providing detailed metrics on your current risk profile and level of maturity. Our consultants help you to identify critical weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers, whilst our bespoke platform generates detailed reports with actionable recommendations. Our framework is divided into the following seven areas, and whilst budgets or time may constrain the depth to which we examine an organisation, we never compromise on the breadth of our review. Governance Policy, process & procedure Technology Data handling Culture & education Physical environment Supply chain Governance Cyber-risk should be treated like any other business risk and should have board level ownership. This review will evaluate the approach to cyber-risk, how it defines roles and responsibilities, and if critical business dependencies have been identified along with the threats posed to them. Policy, process & procedure Appropriate documentation and working practices provide the necessary underlying foundation on which the correct business decisions can be made, whilst demonstrating compliance to relevant legislation and standards. Our review will evaluate existing policies and identify gaps in documentation and working practices that can be addressed to reduce cyber-risk. Technology Technology should comply with, and support, the security policies of an organisation. ICT teams (internal or outsourced) are usually focused on maintaining availability of the technology's functionality, and this can lead to mismanagement of technical security controls. We assess the 'real-life' approach against policies to identify any gaps (vulnerabilities). To this end, we can conduct vulnerability scans of the organisation's external and internal network and devices as part of a policy compliance assessment. Data handling Understanding the data that is processed is crucial not only for establishing and implementing the correct security controls, but also for legal compliance (GDPR). This review will confirm whether an organisation has identified the data it processes, transmits, and stores, and whether it has the necessary security in place to protect it. Culture & education People can be a critical weakness in cyber security but also a key aspect of defence. Understanding levels of awareness within an organisation and its workforce helps to identify areas of strengths and weakness and where to focus programmes of improvement. Culture plays an important role in the security of an organisation and our assessment will evaluate if cyber security awareness and understanding is embedded at all levels. Physical environment We look here at how physical access to an organisations ICT infrastructure is controlled, from server rooms to network access points to individual devices. Often the simplest method of attack is best and stealing or cloning an employee's door pass can gain vital access to sensitive areas of buildings. This is where digital and physical risks overlap, and we always advocate a holistic view of security. Supply chain Critical suppliers and third parties can introduce vulnerabilities to an organisation's business resilience and security. Due diligence should be carried out on critical suppliers and third parties to identify any risks associated with them or the services, products, or systems that they provide. The review will ascertain the level to which supplier risk is addressed within the organisation. Governance Whilst the CYSIAM Pathway framework is bespoke, it does cover the key aspects of several industry leading standards and regulations such as: ► NCSC Cyber Essentials & Cyber Essentials Plus ► ISO 27001 ► NIST Cyber Security Framework (CSF) ► GDPR ► PCI DSS (only used if relevant to business) Big 4 Consulting Firm “CYSIAM's key strengths would be industry experience and technical skills; across the board the CYSIAM team is really powerful in those areas.” Latest insights CYSIAM named CrowdStrike's Rising Star Partner of the Year 2025 Read More CYSIAM Partner with CrowdStrike to Protect UK Defence Supply Chain Read More CYSIAM achieves CREST SOC Accreditation Read More Supporting Organisations in Times of Crisis: CYSIAM awarded NCSC Cyber Incident Response Level 2 Read More Securing the UK Defence Supply Chain: The Impact of Emerging Standards & Certification.

Technology Technology should comply with, and support, the security policies of an organisation. ICT teams (internal or outsourced) are usually focused on maintaining availability of the technology's functionality, and this can lead to mismanagement of technical security controls. We assess the 'real-life' approach against policies to identify any gaps (vulnerabilities). To this end, we can conduct vulnerability scans of the organisation's external and internal network and devices as part of a policy compliance assessment. Data handling Understanding the data that is processed is crucial not only for establishing and implementing the correct security controls, but also for legal compliance (GDPR). This review will confirm whether an organisation has identified the data it processes, transmits, and stores, and whether it has the necessary security in place to protect it. Culture & education People can be a critical weakness in cyber security but also a key aspect of defence. Understanding levels of awareness within an organisation and its workforce helps to identify areas of strengths and weakness and where to focus programmes of improvement. Culture plays an important role in the security of an organisation and our assessment will evaluate if cyber security awareness and understanding is embedded at all levels. Physical environment We look here at how physical access to an organisations ICT infrastructure is controlled, from server rooms to network access points to individual devices. Often the simplest method of attack is best and stealing or cloning an employee's door pass can gain vital access to sensitive areas of buildings. This is where digital and physical risks overlap, and we always advocate a holistic view of security. Supply chain Critical suppliers and third parties can introduce vulnerabilities to an organisation's business resilience and security. Due diligence should be carried out on critical suppliers and third parties to identify any risks associated with them or the services, products, or systems that they provide. The review will ascertain the level to which supplier risk is addressed within the organisation. Governance Governance Cyber-risk should be treated like any other business risk and should have board level ownership. This review will evaluate the approach to cyber-risk, how it defines roles and responsibilities, and if critical business dependencies have been identified along with the threats posed to them. Policy, process & procedure Appropriate documentation and working practices provide the necessary underlying foundation on which the correct business decisions can be made, whilst demonstrating compliance to relevant legislation and standards. Our review will evaluate existing policies and identify gaps in documentation and working practices that can be addressed to reduce cyber-risk.
