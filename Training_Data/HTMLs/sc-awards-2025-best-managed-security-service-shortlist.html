Reject All Save My Preferences Accept All Powered by Reject All Save My Preferences Accept All News & Events Reliance Cyber shortlisted for Best Managed Security Service at SC Awards Europe 2025 Giulia Foss - 30 April 2025 Estimated reading time: 2 minutes Contents About Reliance Cyber London, 30th April 2025 — Reliance Cyber has been named a finalist for Best Managed Security Service at the SC Awards Europe 2025 , recognising its innovative and automation-led approach to delivering high-performance managed security services. The shortlisting acknowledges Reliance Cyber’s Extended Detection and Response (XDR) service, designed to eliminate the complexity, delays, and high costs traditionally associated with building and operating in-house security operations. The service combines expert-led monitoring, automation at scale, and threat intelligence from Google to deliver 24/7 protection for organisations operating in high-risk and regulated sectors. Reliance Cyber’s “SIEM-as-Code” approach allows for the deployment of more than 400 tailored detection rules in under 15 minutes, accelerating time-to-value and removing the need for extensive manual configuration. The platform automates over 2.75 million SOC actions monthly, with sub-one-minute response times and continuous improvement through a growing analytics backlog of more than 900 rules. With a UK-based SC-cleared SOC and a fully managed, cloud-native security stack, Reliance Cyber delivers scalable protection while reducing operational overheads. The service’s fixed-cost subscription model ensures financial predictability, while advanced threat modelling and automation help organisations reduce unnecessary spend and focus resources where they matter most. Designed to support both enterprise and mid-sized organisations, Reliance Cyber’s XDR provides a future-ready foundation for cybersecurity—without the staffing, infrastructure, or complexity burdens of traditional approaches. This nomination highlights Reliance Cyber’s commitment to redefining the managed security model with a solution that is fast, efficient, and accessible to organisations navigating today’s most complex cybersecurity challenges. About Reliance Cyber At Reliance Cyber, we go beyond standard cybersecurity services, we become an extension of your team, working as a trusted partner to defend against the most advanced threats, including those at a nation-state level. Our approach is rooted in deep technical expertise, real-world threat intelligence, and a commitment to proactive security. By understanding the nuances of each organisation’s risk landscape, we craft tailored solutions that don’t just mitigate threats but actively enhance resilience. With Reliance Cyber safeguarding your digital environment, you can focus on driving your business forward with confidence.
