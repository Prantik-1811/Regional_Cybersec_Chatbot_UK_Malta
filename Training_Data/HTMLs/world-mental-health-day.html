Reject All Save My Preferences Accept All Powered by Reject All Save My Preferences Accept All News & Events World Mental Health Day Reliance Cyber - 9 October 2024 Estimated reading time: 3 minutes Since the COVID pandemic, businesses have had to rethink their approach to employee wellbeing after navigating one of the most challenging periods in recent history. Prioritising staff welfare is essential for maintaining a happy, healthy and productive workplace. With the rise of remote working and many offices downsizing, how are companies adapting to support their employees’ wellbeing in this new landscape? Our bi-annual company offsite is the perfect opportunity for our wider remote working teams to come together in person. It was during one particularly intense team-building activity, involving marshmallows and dried spaghetti, that our House Competition was born. And yes, it’s exactly as it sounds! Employees are assigned to different houses and compete in quizzes, challenges, and scavenger hunts, often tied to special occasions or national observances. With house captains, house colours, and a leaderboard tracking house points for participation, this friendly rivalry promotes camaraderie and strengthens connections across departments, building bonds that last outside the day-to-day work. Some of our most successful activities include a nail-biting Euro 2024 match predictor league, a Pride movie night, pizza and Switch games nights at the office and our annual Christmas Quiz. Beyond the office, there is a strong focus on fundraising and each year, our company raises money for a charity chosen by the staff. In the past, we have supported a homeless charity close to our head office, tackled climate change with “plant a tree” schemes and raised money for nationally recognised charities. This year, I pitched a small organisation close to my heart that has supported my family since my dad’s cancer diagnosis. As I write this, we have raised over £3k for the charity, year to date – a massive achievement. The SEF also organise our annual Ultra Challenge – last month we completed the Thames Bridges Trek, previously we have done the Peak District Challenge, the South Coast Challenge and have the Jurassic Coast Challenge lined up for May 2025. These events motivate and inspire individuals to get fit doing something they might not typically consider, allowing them to enjoy downtime with colleagues. Our efforts in creating a positive and engaging workplace have been recognised, as we’ve proudly been listed in The Times Best Places to Work . This accolade is a testament to our dedication of maintaining a supportive, vibrant, and socially responsible business culture that our staff are proud to be part of.
