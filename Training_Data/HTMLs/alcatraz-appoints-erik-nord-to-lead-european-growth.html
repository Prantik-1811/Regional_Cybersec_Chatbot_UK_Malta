SecurityBrief UK - Technology news for CISOs & cybersecurity decision-makers United Kingdom Guides # cloud security # cybersecurity # endpoint protection # firewalls # ransomware Search # Data Protection # Surveillance # Biometrics Alcatraz appoints Erik Nord to lead European growth Wed, 4th Feb 2026 By Joseph Gabriel Lagonsin, News Editor Alcatraz has appointed Erik Nord as Director of Business Development for Europe as it expands its presence across the region. Nord takes responsibility for business development across European markets. He will work with end users, systems integrators and technology partners, according to the company. Alcatraz sells facial biometric authentication for physical access. It positions the technology for use in workplaces and other controlled environments. European push Alcatraz said it sees demand in Europe for biometric access control that addresses privacy and deployment requirements. The company linked its European approach to data protection requirements, including GDPR. "We are seeing tremendous demand and momentum for our privacy-first approach to biometric access control in Europe," said Tina D'Agostin, Chief Executive Officer, Alcatraz. "Organisations want more secure, seamless solutions without compromising privacy or flexibility," said D'Agostin. "Erik's proven track record in building interoperable security ecosystems makes him the right leader to help us accelerate our expansion and deliver value to customers across the region," said D'Agostin. Industry background Nord has more than 20 years of experience in security solutions, according to Alcatraz. The company said his background covers the integration of software and hardware in security systems. He previously held leadership roles in sales and business development at Axis Communications, Genetec and Acre Security. Alcatraz described its model as Facial Authentication-as-a-Service, which it abbreviates as FAaaS. The company said customers can deploy the system on premises or via a cloud subscription model. It also described its system as plug-and-play and intended for use with existing access control infrastructure. The company said it aims to reduce complexity in deployment and ongoing operation. Product positioning Alcatraz said its facial authentication system focuses on privacy and data protection. It said the design supports GDPR-aligned deployments across European markets. The company also framed its offering around physical security that sits alongside existing identity and access processes. Security vendors have increasingly blended physical access control and digital identity management as organisations manage more hybrid working patterns and multi-site estates. In a statement on his appointment, Nord said he would focus on identity verification in security deployments. "The future of security must be built on robust verification of identity," said Erik Nord, Director of Business Development for Europe, Alcatraz. "What stood out to me about Alcatraz is its privacy-first approach to biometrics and the ability to layer seamlessly onto existing environments," said Nord. "The technology works with any existing access control system," said Nord. "I couldn't be more excited to start working with end-users, technology partners and system integrators across Europe," said Nord. Alcatraz said it provides facial authentication for sensitive environments. It did not disclose European customer numbers, revenue, or specific country-level expansion plans as part of the announcement. The company said Nord will play a role in scaling its presence across the continent as it pursues its European growth strategy.
