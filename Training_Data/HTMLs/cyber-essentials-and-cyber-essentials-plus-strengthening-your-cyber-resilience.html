Businesses, regardless of size, are at risk of cyberattacks, which can compromise sensitive data, disrupt operations, and damage reputations. That’s where Cyber Essentials steps in – a government-backed certification scheme designed to protect organisations from the most common cyber threats. Whether you’re just starting your cybersecurity journey or looking to elevate your defences, Cyber Essentials and Cyber Essentials Plus provide a structured framework to enhance your resilience.

The certification comes in two levels: 1. Cyber Essentials (CE) This entry-level certification involves a self-assessment questionnaire that guides you through implementing essential cybersecurity controls. It ensures you are protected against basic threats, serving as your first step towards robust cyber resilience. 2. Cyber Essentials Plus (CE Plus) Building on the Cyber Essentials framework, CE Plus includes a hands-on technical assessment by certified experts. This process involves a detailed audit of your cybersecurity measures, such as malware protection, patch management, and network vulnerabilities. CE Plus provides higher assurance, offering stakeholders greater confidence in your cybersecurity practices.
