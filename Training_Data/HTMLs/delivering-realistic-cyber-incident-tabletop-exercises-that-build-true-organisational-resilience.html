News Article by Nigel Plant, Senior Security Consultant, CyberCrowd. Over the past month CyberCrowd delivered four cyber incident tabletop exercises across several organisations. Two of these were designed specifically for a multinational legal and financial services client with offices in multiple offshore locations, including the Cayman Islands. These sessions included both a leadership level crisis management exercise and a technical investigation tabletop. This article focuses on that two-part programme and how our Senior Consultant created a highly realistic scenario that strengthened both executive decision making and technical incident response capability. Crafting a Scenario Grounded in Reality To ensure the scenario felt authentic, our Senior Consultant worked closely with the client to understand their systems, operating model, and sector specific risks. This preparation allowed every inject to be built using the actual tools, platforms, and naming conventions familiar to their teams. Data exfiltration filenames referenced genuine system names used by the organisation. Log activity was tailored to reflect the client’s real security stack. This removed abstraction and created an environment where participants were responding to situations that closely mirrored their live infrastructure. Drawing on research into ICIJ investigations, including high profile events such as the Panama Papers, our Senior Consultant also developed a realistic dummy leak site. It incorporated images taken from the client’s own public website to heighten the sense of credibility. When this appeared mid exercise it delivered a powerful moment that raised the pressure and immersion for all involved. Leadership Crisis Exercise This session began with an intentional reversal of the traditional narrative. Rather than starting with the IT team discovering an anomaly, the first contact came from a journalist calling the Managing Director of the Cayman office, alleging possession of leaked client data. This was followed by staged screenshots of the supposed files, enquiries from a high profile client seeking reassurance, and pressure from regulators requesting early information. Each inject was designed to challenge the executive team’s judgement, prioritisation, and communication discipline. The leadership group responded with clarity and structure. They demonstrated strong understanding of escalation paths, a disciplined approach to compliance considerations, and careful control over external messaging while ensuring they avoided assumptions. Their decision making aligned well with best practice crisis management. Technical Investigation Exercise The technical tabletop brought together the CISO, CTO, the Information Security Manager, the Service Desk Manager, and teams located across multiple offshore sites. They were presented with a sequence of injects that required structured investigation, evidence preservation, and timely reporting. Injects included: Initial escalation from the executive team after the journalist’s contact Suspicious activity identified within Azure ID where security logs had been cleared Consideration of access by a former IT employee Discovery of a large file transfer captured by Mimecast Preparation of a detailed findings report for the executive team The teams collaborated effectively, demonstrated clear analytical thinking, and consistently aligned their actions with the incident response plan and forensic evidence procedure. Their discussions were strong and predictive, often anticipating the next inject based on their investigative logic. Tangible Outcomes for the Organisation Across both sessions the organisation gained valuable insights into how a serious data leak scenario might unfold and what actions would be required at both strategic and technical levels. Key outcomes included: Greater confidence and maturity within the leadership team in managing crisis communications and regulatory interactions Validation of the IT and security teams investigative processes Improved understanding of evidence preservation and structured analysis Clearer alignment between business leaders and technical teams during high pressure events These exercises provided genuine learning value and offered the organisation a realistic view of its resilience and areas for enhancement. As part of the wider programme of four exercises delivered this month, CyberCrowd continues to support organisations in preparing for complex cyber incidents through realistic, well structured, and sector relevant tabletop scenarios.

Over the past month CyberCrowd delivered four cyber incident tabletop exercises across several organisations. Two of these were designed specifically for a multinational legal and financial services client with offices in multiple offshore locations, including the Cayman Islands. These sessions included both a leadership level crisis management exercise and a technical investigation tabletop. This article focuses on that two-part programme and how our Senior Consultant created a highly realistic scenario that strengthened both executive decision making and technical incident response capability. Crafting a Scenario Grounded in Reality To ensure the scenario felt authentic, our Senior Consultant worked closely with the client to understand their systems, operating model, and sector specific risks. This preparation allowed every inject to be built using the actual tools, platforms, and naming conventions familiar to their teams. Data exfiltration filenames referenced genuine system names used by the organisation. Log activity was tailored to reflect the client’s real security stack. This removed abstraction and created an environment where participants were responding to situations that closely mirrored their live infrastructure. Drawing on research into ICIJ investigations, including high profile events such as the Panama Papers, our Senior Consultant also developed a realistic dummy leak site. It incorporated images taken from the client’s own public website to heighten the sense of credibility. When this appeared mid exercise it delivered a powerful moment that raised the pressure and immersion for all involved. Leadership Crisis Exercise This session began with an intentional reversal of the traditional narrative. Rather than starting with the IT team discovering an anomaly, the first contact came from a journalist calling the Managing Director of the Cayman office, alleging possession of leaked client data. This was followed by staged screenshots of the supposed files, enquiries from a high profile client seeking reassurance, and pressure from regulators requesting early information. Each inject was designed to challenge the executive team’s judgement, prioritisation, and communication discipline. The leadership group responded with clarity and structure. They demonstrated strong understanding of escalation paths, a disciplined approach to compliance considerations, and careful control over external messaging while ensuring they avoided assumptions. Their decision making aligned well with best practice crisis management. Technical Investigation Exercise The technical tabletop brought together the CISO, CTO, the Information Security Manager, the Service Desk Manager, and teams located across multiple offshore sites. They were presented with a sequence of injects that required structured investigation, evidence preservation, and timely reporting. Injects included: Initial escalation from the executive team after the journalist’s contact Suspicious activity identified within Azure ID where security logs had been cleared Consideration of access by a former IT employee Discovery of a large file transfer captured by Mimecast Preparation of a detailed findings report for the executive team The teams collaborated effectively, demonstrated clear analytical thinking, and consistently aligned their actions with the incident response plan and forensic evidence procedure. Their discussions were strong and predictive, often anticipating the next inject based on their investigative logic. Tangible Outcomes for the Organisation Across both sessions the organisation gained valuable insights into how a serious data leak scenario might unfold and what actions would be required at both strategic and technical levels. Key outcomes included: Greater confidence and maturity within the leadership team in managing crisis communications and regulatory interactions Validation of the IT and security teams investigative processes Improved understanding of evidence preservation and structured analysis Clearer alignment between business leaders and technical teams during high pressure events These exercises provided genuine learning value and offered the organisation a realistic view of its resilience and areas for enhancement.
