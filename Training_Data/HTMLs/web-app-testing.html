Web App testing Because of the vast amount of data stored in web applications and the growing number of online transactions, proper Web Application Security Testing is becoming increasingly important. Web applications are critical to a company’s success and are therefore a tempting target for hackers. With web applications being used daily by businesses and consumers alike, it is essential that regular tests are undertaken to ensure that there are no vulnerabilities. All of our web application penetration tests are undertaken by a team of qualified and certified professionals that are well-versed in the most recent methodology and techniques used by hackers to exploit vulnerabilities within web applications. Our clearly defined process ensures we clearly identify and exploit the vulnerabilities within your Web App. All of our testing is mapped against the OWASP (Open Web Application Server Project) testing criteria, which defines the common critical web application issues. Any vulnerabilities which we identify are then exploited further by our team and collated into a comprehensive report summarising our findings. Some common vulnerabilities identified are: URL Manipulation SQL Injection API Exploitation XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Spoofing Our process allows us to check issues both unauthenticated and authenticated, allowing us to paint a true picture of your overall weaknesses. This real-world insight of how your web app can be susceptible to hackers allows us to enhance your session management controls and improve your system authentication.
