For the avoidance of doubt, where preparation of the Goods has been completed and the Customer cancels a related Order Form, and any Specification of such Goods is bespoke such that it restricts the ability of Reliance or the Manufacturer to sell the Goods to an alternative client, the Customer shall remain liable for the full Charges in relation to such Goods. 12.4. Where the Customer cancels an Order Form for Professional Services pursuant to Clause 12.1 or reschedules Professional Services that have been booked for delivery on dates agreed between the Parties, Reliance reserves the right to charge the following cancellation fees where the cancellation or reschedule request was: (i) less than one (1) Business Day prior to the date on which the Professional Services were to commence, one hundred percent (100%) of the applicable Charges; (ii) one (1) to five (5) Business Days prior to the date on which the Professional Services were to commence, fifty percent (50%) of the applicable Charges; (iii) one to three (1-3) weeks prior to the date on which the Professional Services were to commence, twenty five ( 25%) of the applicable Charges. 12.5.
