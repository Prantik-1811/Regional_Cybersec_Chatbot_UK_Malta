Reject All Save My Preferences Accept All Powered by Reject All Save My Preferences Accept All Blog Post From steel to silicon part 2: What can go wrong – Attack vectors and nightmare scenarios in the software-defined vehicle Reliance Cyber - 26 January 2026 Estimated reading time: 8 minutes Contents The car as the next cyber battleground Real-world incidents: 2024 snapshot Why this is different from traditional IT Trend towards targeting backend systems Speculative scenarios: Worst-case futures The common thread: Complexity and connectivity The modern car is no longer a mechanical device with a few wires and gears. It’s a distributed computing platform, a mobile edge node, and a cloud-connected sensor array—all wrapped in a chassis. And like any complex digital system, it’s vulnerable. In this post, we’ll explore the expanding attack surface of connected vehicles, the real-world incidents already shaking the industry, and the speculative—but technically plausible—scenarios that could define the next generation of automotive cyber threats. The car as the next cyber battleground Today’s vehicles contain: 100+ sensors 30–50 ECUs (Electronic Control Unit) Multiple wireless interfaces (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC, UWB) 2–3 cellular modems Cloud APIs for telemetry, OTA updates, and remote control V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) protocols for infrastructure communication Charging interfaces with bidirectional data channels This isn’t just complexity—it’s entropy. Each subsystem introduces its own firmware, protocol stack, and threat model. And attackers are no longer limited to physical access or CAN bus injection. They’re exploiting cloud misconfigurations, mobile app vulnerabilities, and backend API flaws to compromise vehicles at scale. Real-world incidents: 2024 snapshot According to Upstream’s 2025 report and EE Times coverage, here’s how the threat landscape evolved last year: Attack Type % of Incidents Estimated Incidents (2024) Description Data Privacy Breaches 60% ~245 GPS history, driver profiles, payment data Service Disruption 53% ~217 Ransomware targeting dealerships and OEMs Vehicle Manipulation 35% ~143 Remote unlocking, ECU spoofing, infotainment exploits Odometer Fraud 20% ~82 CAN injection, diagnostic tool abuse API Exploits 17% ~70 Token theft, replay attacks, backend compromise ECU Attacks 8% ~33 Firmware manipulation of safety-critical systems EV Charger Exploits 6% ~25 Billing fraud, firmware tampering, grid disruption Total documented incidents in 2024: 409. Cumulative incidents since 2010: 1,877 These numbers reflect only publicly reported and verified incidents. The real figures—especially for backend API exploits and EV infrastructure—may be significantly higher due to underreporting and lack of centralised disclosure mechanisms. Why this is different from traditional IT Physical consequences: A compromised vehicle isn’t just a data leak—it’s a kinetic threat. Heterogeneous systems: Linux containers, QNX RTOS, Android Automotive, CAN-FD, Ethernet—all coexisting. Long lifecycle: Vulnerabilities may persist for years due to slow update cycles and fragmented supply chains. Remote control: OEMs can immobilise vehicles, push updates, or modify behaviour via cloud commands. This isn’t just cybersecurity—it’s cyber-physical security. Trend towards targeting backend systems The most alarming trend? Backend systems are now the primary target. In 2024, more than half of attacks originated in cloud platforms – not the vehicle itself. The backend is the new perimeter. Attackers increasingly target cloud systems not because they’re easier to breach, but because they offer centralised control over thousands of vehicles. Once inside, they can: Push malicious OTA updates Extract telemetry and user data Trigger remote immobilisation Manipulate fleet-wide behaviour This shift in origin point is why backend security – not just in-vehicle hardening – is now a top priority for OEMs and regulators. Speculative scenarios: Worst-case futures Let’s step beyond the headlines and explore what could happen if attackers weaponise the whole stack of vehicle connectivity. These aren’t science fiction—they’re extrapolations based on known vulnerabilities, architectural weaknesses, and emerging threat vectors. 1. EV Charger Worm: The Automotive Stuxnet Imagine a malware strain that propagates via EV charging ports. It exploits vulnerabilities in the TLC (Tesla Charging Language) or ISO 15118 handshake protocol, injecting malicious payloads into the vehicle’s telematics or infotainment system. Once infected, the vehicle becomes a vector—spreading the malware to every charger it connects to. Those chargers, in turn, infect the next vehicle. Within days, entire urban fleets are compromised. There can be multiple payload options: Overcharging batteries to thermal runaway Disabling brakes or steering via ECU manipulation Remote immobilisation triggered by time or location Ransomware lockout demanding crypto payments to unlock ignition This scenario mirrors the propagation model of Stuxnet, but with physical mobility and public infrastructure as the transmission medium. 2. API Hijack at Scale A vulnerability in a major OEM’s backend cloud API could allow attackers to: Enumerate VINs Extract telemetry Push OTA updates Trigger remote immobilisation Using token replay or insecure endpoints, attackers compromise thousands of vehicles simultaneously. The result? A coordinated lockout of an entire fleet—ride-hailing services, delivery vans, or public transport. This isn’t hypothetical. In 2022, a researcher exploited insecure APIs to remotely control dozens of vehicles across multiple brands. The only thing missing was scale and intent. 3. Infotainment Rootkit via Application Store As Android Automotive OS becomes mainstream, OEMs open app stores for third-party developers. A malicious app—disguised as a navigation plugin—exploits a sandbox escape vulnerability to gain root access. Once installed, it: Records cabin audio and video Extracts Wi-Fi credentials and cloud tokens Injects CAN messages to manipulate vehicle behaviour Because the app is signed and distributed via the OEM’s store, it bypasses user scrutiny. The rootkit persists across updates and spreads via sideloading or phishing links. 4. V2X Spoofing and Phantom Traffic Vehicles increasingly rely on V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communication for collision avoidance, traffic optimisation, and autonomous navigation. An attacker sets up rogue roadside units (RSUs) broadcasting false data. Possible effects are: Vehicles slam brakes for phantom obstacles Traffic rerouted into gridlock Emergency vehicles delayed or misdirected This attack doesn’t require compromising the vehicle—just manipulating the environment. It’s low-cost, high-impact, and difficult to trace. 5. Fleet-Wide Ransomware via Telematics Platform A vulnerability in a popular telematics provider allows attackers to push malicious updates to all connected vehicles. The payload encrypts infotainment systems, disables navigation, and locks out fleet managers. Victims could include: Logistics companies Municipal services Emergency responders The ransom demand is issued via the fleet dashboard. Pay or lose operational control. 6. Biometric Data Leak via Cabin Intelligence Modern vehicles collect biometric data: facial recognition for driver profiles, heart rate monitoring, and fatigue detection. A misconfigured cloud bucket exposes this data publicly. Possible consequences are: Identity theft Insurance fraud Targeted surveillance This isn’t just a privacy breach—it’s a violation of bodily autonomy. The common thread: Complexity and connectivity Each of these scenarios exploits a different layer of the automotive stack: Physical interfaces (EV charging) Cloud APIs Infotainment OS V2X protocols Telematics platforms Biometric sensors What ties them together is the increasing reliance on software, mainstream IT components, and always-on connectivity. The same tools that enable innovation also enable exploitation. What’s next? In Part 3, we’ll explore how the industry is responding. From regulatory frameworks like UN R155 and ISO/SAE 21434 to architectural shifts like zonal compute and secure gateways, automakers are racing to build resilience. But are they moving fast enough?

Long lifecycle: Vulnerabilities may persist for years due to slow update cycles and fragmented supply chains. Remote control: OEMs can immobilise vehicles, push updates, or modify behaviour via cloud commands. This isn’t just cybersecurity—it’s cyber-physical security. Trend towards targeting backend systems The most alarming trend? Backend systems are now the primary target. In 2024, more than half of attacks originated in cloud platforms – not the vehicle itself. The backend is the new perimeter. Attackers increasingly target cloud systems not because they’re easier to breach, but because they offer centralised control over thousands of vehicles. Once inside, they can: Push malicious OTA updates Extract telemetry and user data Trigger remote immobilisation Manipulate fleet-wide behaviour This shift in origin point is why backend security – not just in-vehicle hardening – is now a top priority for OEMs and regulators. Speculative scenarios: Worst-case futures Let’s step beyond the headlines and explore what could happen if attackers weaponise the whole stack of vehicle connectivity. These aren’t science fiction—they’re extrapolations based on known vulnerabilities, architectural weaknesses, and emerging threat vectors. 1. EV Charger Worm: The Automotive Stuxnet Imagine a malware strain that propagates via EV charging ports. It exploits vulnerabilities in the TLC (Tesla Charging Language) or ISO 15118 handshake protocol, injecting malicious payloads into the vehicle’s telematics or infotainment system. Once infected, the vehicle becomes a vector—spreading the malware to every charger it connects to. Those chargers, in turn, infect the next vehicle. Within days, entire urban fleets are compromised. There can be multiple payload options: Overcharging batteries to thermal runaway Disabling brakes or steering via ECU manipulation Remote immobilisation triggered by time or location Ransomware lockout demanding crypto payments to unlock ignition This scenario mirrors the propagation model of Stuxnet, but with physical mobility and public infrastructure as the transmission medium. 2. API Hijack at Scale A vulnerability in a major OEM’s backend cloud API could allow attackers to: Enumerate VINs Extract telemetry Push OTA updates Trigger remote immobilisation Using token replay or insecure endpoints, attackers compromise thousands of vehicles simultaneously. The result? A coordinated lockout of an entire fleet—ride-hailing services, delivery vans, or public transport. This isn’t hypothetical. In 2022, a researcher exploited insecure APIs to remotely control dozens of vehicles across multiple brands. The only thing missing was scale and intent. 3. Infotainment Rootkit via Application Store As Android Automotive OS becomes mainstream, OEMs open app stores for third-party developers. A malicious app—disguised as a navigation plugin—exploits a sandbox escape vulnerability to gain root access. Once installed, it: Records cabin audio and video Extracts Wi-Fi credentials and cloud tokens Injects CAN messages to manipulate vehicle behaviour Because the app is signed and distributed via the OEM’s store, it bypasses user scrutiny. The rootkit persists across updates and spreads via sideloading or phishing links. 4. V2X Spoofing and Phantom Traffic Vehicles increasingly rely on V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communication for collision avoidance, traffic optimisation, and autonomous navigation. An attacker sets up rogue roadside units (RSUs) broadcasting false data. Possible effects are: Vehicles slam brakes for phantom obstacles Traffic rerouted into gridlock Emergency vehicles delayed or misdirected This attack doesn’t require compromising the vehicle—just manipulating the environment. It’s low-cost, high-impact, and difficult to trace. 5. Fleet-Wide Ransomware via Telematics Platform A vulnerability in a popular telematics provider allows attackers to push malicious updates to all connected vehicles. The payload encrypts infotainment systems, disables navigation, and locks out fleet managers. Victims could include: Logistics companies Municipal services Emergency responders The ransom demand is issued via the fleet dashboard. Pay or lose operational control. 6. Biometric Data Leak via Cabin Intelligence Modern vehicles collect biometric data: facial recognition for driver profiles, heart rate monitoring, and fatigue detection. A misconfigured cloud bucket exposes this data publicly. Possible consequences are: Identity theft Insurance fraud Targeted surveillance This isn’t just a privacy breach—it’s a violation of bodily autonomy. The common thread: Complexity and connectivity Each of these scenarios exploits a different layer of the automotive stack: Physical interfaces (EV charging) Cloud APIs Infotainment OS V2X protocols Telematics platforms Biometric sensors What ties them together is the increasing reliance on software, mainstream IT components, and always-on connectivity. The same tools that enable innovation also enable exploitation. What’s next? In Part 3, we’ll explore how the industry is responding. From regulatory frameworks like UN R155 and ISO/SAE 21434 to architectural shifts like zonal compute and secure gateways, automakers are racing to build resilience. But are they moving fast enough?

It’s a distributed computing platform, a mobile edge node, and a cloud-connected sensor array—all wrapped in a chassis. And like any complex digital system, it’s vulnerable. In this post, we’ll explore the expanding attack surface of connected vehicles, the real-world incidents already shaking the industry, and the speculative—but technically plausible—scenarios that could define the next generation of automotive cyber threats.

Remote control: OEMs can immobilise vehicles, push updates, or modify behaviour via cloud commands. This isn’t just cybersecurity—it’s cyber-physical security. Why this is different from traditional IT Physical consequences: A compromised vehicle isn’t just a data leak—it’s a kinetic threat.

Trend towards targeting backend systems The most alarming trend? Backend systems are now the primary target. In 2024, more than half of attacks originated in cloud platforms – not the vehicle itself. The backend is the new perimeter. Attackers increasingly target cloud systems not because they’re easier to breach, but because they offer centralised control over thousands of vehicles. Once inside, they can: Push malicious OTA updates Extract telemetry and user data Trigger remote immobilisation Manipulate fleet-wide behaviour This shift in origin point is why backend security – not just in-vehicle hardening – is now a top priority for OEMs and regulators.

Speculative scenarios: Worst-case futures Let’s step beyond the headlines and explore what could happen if attackers weaponise the whole stack of vehicle connectivity. These aren’t science fiction—they’re extrapolations based on known vulnerabilities, architectural weaknesses, and emerging threat vectors. 1. EV Charger Worm: The Automotive Stuxnet Imagine a malware strain that propagates via EV charging ports. It exploits vulnerabilities in the TLC (Tesla Charging Language) or ISO 15118 handshake protocol, injecting malicious payloads into the vehicle’s telematics or infotainment system. Once infected, the vehicle becomes a vector—spreading the malware to every charger it connects to. Those chargers, in turn, infect the next vehicle. Within days, entire urban fleets are compromised. There can be multiple payload options: Overcharging batteries to thermal runaway Disabling brakes or steering via ECU manipulation Remote immobilisation triggered by time or location Ransomware lockout demanding crypto payments to unlock ignition This scenario mirrors the propagation model of Stuxnet, but with physical mobility and public infrastructure as the transmission medium. 2. API Hijack at Scale A vulnerability in a major OEM’s backend cloud API could allow attackers to: Trigger remote immobilisation Using token replay or insecure endpoints, attackers compromise thousands of vehicles simultaneously. The result? A coordinated lockout of an entire fleet—ride-hailing services, delivery vans, or public transport. This isn’t hypothetical. In 2022, a researcher exploited insecure APIs to remotely control dozens of vehicles across multiple brands. The only thing missing was scale and intent. 3. Infotainment Rootkit via Application Store As Android Automotive OS becomes mainstream, OEMs open app stores for third-party developers. A malicious app—disguised as a navigation plugin—exploits a sandbox escape vulnerability to gain root access. Once installed, it: Records cabin audio and video Extracts Wi-Fi credentials and cloud tokens Injects CAN messages to manipulate vehicle behaviour Because the app is signed and distributed via the OEM’s store, it bypasses user scrutiny. The rootkit persists across updates and spreads via sideloading or phishing links. 4. V2X Spoofing and Phantom Traffic Vehicles increasingly rely on V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communication for collision avoidance, traffic optimisation, and autonomous navigation. An attacker sets up rogue roadside units (RSUs) broadcasting false data. Possible effects are: Vehicles slam brakes for phantom obstacles Traffic rerouted into gridlock Emergency vehicles delayed or misdirected This attack doesn’t require compromising the vehicle—just manipulating the environment. It’s low-cost, high-impact, and difficult to trace. 5. Fleet-Wide Ransomware via Telematics Platform A vulnerability in a popular telematics provider allows attackers to push malicious updates to all connected vehicles. The payload encrypts infotainment systems, disables navigation, and locks out fleet managers. Victims could include: The ransom demand is issued via the fleet dashboard. Pay or lose operational control. 6. Biometric Data Leak via Cabin Intelligence Modern vehicles collect biometric data: facial recognition for driver profiles, heart rate monitoring, and fatigue detection. A misconfigured cloud bucket exposes this data publicly. Possible consequences are: Targeted surveillance This isn’t just a privacy breach—it’s a violation of bodily autonomy. The common thread: Complexity and connectivity Each of these scenarios exploits a different layer of the automotive stack: Physical interfaces (EV charging) Cloud APIs Infotainment OS V2X protocols Telematics platforms Biometric sensors What ties them together is the increasing reliance on software, mainstream IT components, and always-on connectivity. The same tools that enable innovation also enable exploitation. What’s next? In Part 3, we’ll explore how the industry is responding. From regulatory frameworks like UN R155 and ISO/SAE 21434 to architectural shifts like zonal compute and secure gateways, automakers are racing to build resilience. But are they moving fast enough? Stay tuned.
