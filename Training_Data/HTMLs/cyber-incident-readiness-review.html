Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Incident Response Cyber Incident Readiness Review (CIRR) We baseline an organisation's ability to withstand & recover from a serious cyber attack, providing actionable recommendations for improvement. Communicate & mitigate risk. A Cyber Incident Readiness Review (IRR) assesses your organisation’s ability to detect and respond to a cyber security incident. We examine not only your incident response capability, but also threat and event management, and business continuity. CIRR is an effective way for Technical teams to articulate to non-technical C-Suite stakeholders the risk they are ultimately accountable for. We explain the consequences of identified gaps in a non-technical language, providing actionable and proportionate recommendations as to remediation. Speak to us Our Approach We conduct a systematic evaluation of your preparedness to detect, respond to, and recover from cyber security incidents. The first step is to assess existing policies and procedures to ensure they are comprehensive and up-to-date with the latest threats and regulatory requirements. This includes reviewing the incident response plan, communication strategies, and the roles and responsibilities assigned during a cyber incident. Next, we test the organisation's readiness through simulations and drills. These activities help to uncover gaps in the incident response process and evaluate the effectiveness of communication channels, both internally and with external stakeholders such as regulators and law enforcement agencies. By systematically addressing these areas, an organisation can enhance its resilience against cyber threats and minimise the potential impact of security breaches. Benefits Enhanced Incident Preparedness: We help you identify gaps in your current cyber response plans, ensuring you are well-prepared to handle real-world incidents effectively and minimise disruption. Tailored Risk Mitigation: Reviews are customised to the specific needs and threat landscape of your organisation, allowing for more targeted recommendations to reduce cyber risk. Regulatory and Compliance Assurance: By aligning with key standards such as the NCSC’s guidance and GDPR requirements, we support you in meeting regulatory obligations and avoiding potential penalties. Improved Stakeholder Confidence: Demonstrating a robust readiness strategy reassures stakeholders that you take cybersecurity seriously and can respond decisively to threats.
