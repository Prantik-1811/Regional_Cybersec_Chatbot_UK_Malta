News October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month , and here at CyberCrowd , we’re continuing our mission to help everyone – individuals and organisations – take simple, effective steps to Stay Safe Online . We’ve already covered strong passwords and multifactor authentication (MFA) as part of our Core 4 steps to better cybersecurity. Now it’s time to look at something we’re all guilty of ignoring: software updates. “Remind Me Later” – The Most Dangerous Button on Your Screen We’ve all done it. You’re in the middle of something, a pop-up appears, and you click “Remind me later.” It feels harmless – but those updates are far more important than they seem. Software updates patch flaws, close security gaps, and often include new tools to help protect you. Delaying them can leave your devices (and your data) open to attack. Why Software Updates Matter Updates aren’t just about new features or fancy icons. They’re a vital line of defence. Here’s what those updates really do behind the scenes: Patch flaws found in the software’s programming Improve security to fend off new and evolving threats Add new features – often security ones, like built-in VPNs or password managers When you’re alerted that a new update is available, the best thing you can do is update right now . It usually takes only a few minutes, your browser tabs will reload (mostly!), and it’s one of the easiest ways to stay safe online. Even if you’ve enabled automatic updates, it’s worth checking periodically – just to be sure you’ve got the latest protection. And if your device needs to restart? Let it. Your workplace will appreciate your commitment to security – and your personal data deserves that same level of care. It’s Not Just Work Devices Cybersecurity doesn’t stop at the office door. Many people forget about the growing number of devices connected to their home networks – from children’s tablets and gaming consoles to smart speakers, doorbells, even Wi-Fi-enabled fridges! Every device connected to your network is another potential doorway for hackers. That’s why it’s so important to keep everything updated, not just your laptop. Fridge? Doorbell? Lightbulb? Dog collar? (Yes, really.) If it connects to your Wi-Fi, it needs to stay up to date. What This Means for Businesses For organisations, software updates are one of the simplest and most effective cybersecurity measures you can implement. Outdated software is a leading cause of security incidents – attackers often exploit known vulnerabilities in unpatched systems to gain access. Businesses can protect themselves by: Enforcing regular update schedules across all systems and devices Managing automatic updates through IT policies Training staff to recognise and respond to update prompts (rather than ignoring them!) Including IoT devices, remote laptops, and mobile phones in security maintenance plans Regular patching doesn’t just keep systems safe – it keeps operations smooth, data secure, and customers confident. Let Your Tech Do the Heavy Lifting Automatic updates are your friend. Turn them on wherever possible – on your laptop, your phone, and all those smart devices around the home or office. They’ll handle the heavy lifting, ensuring you’re always running the latest and most secure versions of your software. Because staying safe online doesn’t have to be complicated – it just takes consistency. Stay Safe Online with CyberCrowd This Cybersecurity Awareness Month, we’re focusing on practical, people-first steps that make a real difference. So next time that update alert pops up, don’t click “Remind me later.” Click Update Now – your security (and your future self) will thank you. At CyberCrowd , we help organisations stay ahead of cyber threats through proactive protection, visibility, and resilience. From 24/7 monitoring to managed patching and endpoint protection, we make sure your business stays secure – so you can focus on what you do best.

Dog collar? (Yes, really.) If it connects to your Wi-Fi, it needs to stay up to date. What This Means for Businesses For organisations, software updates are one of the simplest and most effective cybersecurity measures you can implement. Outdated software is a leading cause of security incidents – attackers often exploit known vulnerabilities in unpatched systems to gain access. Businesses can protect themselves by: Enforcing regular update schedules across all systems and devices Managing automatic updates through IT policies Training staff to recognise and respond to update prompts (rather than ignoring them!) Including IoT devices, remote laptops, and mobile phones in security maintenance plans Regular patching doesn’t just keep systems safe – it keeps operations smooth, data secure, and customers confident. Let Your Tech Do the Heavy Lifting Automatic updates are your friend. Turn them on wherever possible – on your laptop, your phone, and all those smart devices around the home or office. They’ll handle the heavy lifting, ensuring you’re always running the latest and most secure versions of your software. Because staying safe online doesn’t have to be complicated – it just takes consistency.

We’ve already covered strong passwords and multifactor authentication (MFA) as part of our Core 4 steps to better cybersecurity. Now it’s time to look at something we’re all guilty of ignoring: software updates. “Remind Me Later” – The Most Dangerous Button on Your Screen We’ve all done it. You’re in the middle of something, a pop-up appears, and you click “Remind me later.” It feels harmless – but those updates are far more important than they seem. Software updates patch flaws, close security gaps, and often include new tools to help protect you. Delaying them can leave your devices (and your data) open to attack. Why Software Updates Matter Updates aren’t just about new features or fancy icons. They’re a vital line of defence. Here’s what those updates really do behind the scenes: Patch flaws found in the software’s programming Improve security to fend off new and evolving threats Add new features – often security ones, like built-in VPNs or password managers When you’re alerted that a new update is available, the best thing you can do is update right now . It usually takes only a few minutes, your browser tabs will reload (mostly!), and it’s one of the easiest ways to stay safe online. Even if you’ve enabled automatic updates, it’s worth checking periodically – just to be sure you’ve got the latest protection. And if your device needs to restart? Let it. Your workplace will appreciate your commitment to security – and your personal data deserves that same level of care. It’s Not Just Work Devices Cybersecurity doesn’t stop at the office door. Many people forget about the growing number of devices connected to their home networks – from children’s tablets and gaming consoles to smart speakers, doorbells, even Wi-Fi-enabled fridges! Every device connected to your network is another potential doorway for hackers. That’s why it’s so important to keep everything updated, not just your laptop. Fridge? Doorbell? Lightbulb?
