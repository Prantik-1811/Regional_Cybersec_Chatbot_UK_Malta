How We Use Your Information: We will use your personal information for the following purposes: To provide material to you about any of our services that we believe may be of interest to you; To communicate with you in relation to the services you or your employer has contracted from us; and For other legal or legitimate reasons as permitted by legislation such as to inform you of marketing or other events we are organising. 3.

The transmission of data over the internet (including by e-mail) is never completely secure. So although we use appropriate measures to try to protect personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted to us or by us. 4. Your Rights: You have various rights in relation to your personal data. You have a right to: obtain confirmation that we are processing your personal data and request a copy of the personal data we hold about you. be informed about the processing of your personal data (i.e., for what purposes, what types, to what recipients it is disclosed, storage periods, any third-party sources from where it was obtained, confirmation of whether we undertake automated decision-making, including profiling, and the logic, significance and envisaged consequences); ask that we update the personal data we hold about you, or correct such personal data that you think is incorrect or incomplete. ask that we delete personal data that we hold about you, or restrict the way in which we use such personal data; withdraw consent to our processing of your personal data (to the extent such processing is based on previously obtained consent). ask us to stop or start sending you marketing messages at any time by using the contact details here ( https://www.reliancecyber.com/contact-us/ ); and object to our processing of your personal data.
