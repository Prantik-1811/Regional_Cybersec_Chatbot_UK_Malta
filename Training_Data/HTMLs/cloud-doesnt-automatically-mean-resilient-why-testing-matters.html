News In today’s business world, moving to the cloud is often seen as the ultimate solution for flexibility, scalability, and resilience. Many organisations assume that hosting their systems and data in AWS, Azure, or GCP automatically protects them from outages, failures, or data loss. The reality? Cloud doesn’t guarantee resilience – it only provides the tools. Resilience, redundancy, and recovery are capabilities that must be intentionally designed, tested, and maintained . The Risks of a False Sense of Security Before the cloud, organisations were used to regularly testing their Business Continuity Plans (BCP) and Disaster Recovery (DR) procedures. Teams understood their roles, and systems were routinely exercised to ensure they could recover quickly from an incident. Today, many businesses assume that simply moving to a cloud platform makes them resilient. The recent AWS outage, caused by DNS issues, highlighted how quickly critical services can become unavailable -even in the cloud. When reliance on cloud services creates complacency, organisations are vulnerable. Backups, failover systems, and disaster recovery plans are only as good as the testing behind them . Key Questions to Assess Your Cloud Resilience To ensure your cloud-hosted systems are truly resilient, consider these questions: Single points of failure: Do you know which parts of your environment could take your operations offline if they fail? Failover and recovery processes: Have these been designed and tested to work under pressure? Backup strategy: Are backups stored in a separate region or even across multiple clouds? Recovery objectives: Do your RTOs (Recovery Time Objectives) and RPOs (Recovery Point Objectives) align with your business impact tolerances? Document version vs. data backup: Are you clear that cloud document version control is not a true data backup? Moving From Assumption to Assurance Cloud technology gives businesses incredible flexibility – but resilience is not automatic . It must be consciously designed , validated through testing , and continually maintained . Organisations that treat cloud resilience as a checklist item risk slow recovery, lost data, and operational downtime when incidents occur. The real test of resilience is not where your systems are hosted – it’s how well your teams and systems can respond when disruption hits . Building True Cloud Resilience At CyberCrowd, we help organisations turn static cloud strategies into living capabilities . Through realistic scenario testing, robust failover design, and continuous validation, we ensure that your teams and systems are ready to respond, recover, and lead through disruption . Resilience isn’t about surviving the outage – it’s about being ready to thrive through it .
