SecurityBrief UK - Technology news for CISOs & cybersecurity decision-makers United Kingdom Guides # cloud security # cybersecurity # endpoint protection # firewalls # ransomware Search # Data Analytics # Digital Transformation # Planning SolarWinds revamps global partner programme with tiers Fri, 6th Feb 2026 (Today) By Sofiah Nichole Salivio, News Editor SolarWinds has rolled out a refreshed global partner programme, adding tiered incentives, expanded marketing support, and new enablement and specialisation options for channel partners. The changes were unveiled at its February Partner Summit and are positioned as a shift in how SolarWinds works with partners across sales, marketing, and training, with a focus on the day-to-day experience of operating in the programme. The updated structure introduces a tiered benefits model. Partners that move up tiers will qualify for higher discounts and incentives, linked to metrics such as channel-initiated growth. SolarWinds also plans to work more closely with distributors under the new model. It is coordinating with distribution partners so programme requirements and benefits flow through to resellers, including published reseller benefits. Another element is a planned North America pilot rewards centre. Under the pilot, partner sellers will accrue points that can be exchanged for rewards, including cash and prizes. Marketing investment The refreshed programme increases marketing support based on tier status. SolarWinds is expanding investment in partner-led demand generation to help build and sustain sales pipeline through channel activity. The marketing package includes proposal-based marketing funds, co-brandable assets, and pre-packaged "campaigns in a box" available through the partner portal. SolarWinds also says the updates are designed to help partners drive demand more consistently in their markets. Training and specialisation SolarWinds is adding new enablement options for 2026, building on earlier updates that included role-based certifications. Plans include an expanded curriculum and new enablement content for partners. The programme also introduces new specialisations based on subject matter expertise, services, and vertical markets. Public sector is one of the additions. Partner portal changes Alongside the commercial and training updates, SolarWinds is updating the partner portal to streamline the partner experience, including deal registration and lead sharing. It also plans changes to the not-for-resale request process, plus onboarding and business planning checklists. The updates point to a focus on standardising how partners register opportunities and access internal resources. SolarWinds framed the refresh as part of a wider channel strategy, aimed at making benefits and programme mechanics more predictable while encouraging partners to invest in growth as they progress through the tiers. Barb Huelskamp, VP of Global Channel Sales and Alliances at SolarWinds, linked the new programme to broader company priorities and partner economics. "Our enhanced 2026 Partner Programme provides a renewed foundation to drive great customer outcomes and an improved overall partner ecosystem," said Barb Huelskamp, VP of Global Channel Sales and Alliances, SolarWinds. Senior leadership also used the summit to position the partner programme within the company's broader product and customer messaging. SolarWinds sells observability and IT management software and has increasingly emphasised reliability and risk management in its market positioning. CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna said the investments are intended to strengthen partner delivery against those themes. "This programme reflects our serious commitment to a partner-first culture at SolarWinds," said Sudhakar Ramakrishna, CEO, SolarWinds. SolarWinds also announced its annual partner awards at the summit, noting that further information was available separately. In the coming months, SolarWinds plans to progress distributor alignment work, launch the improved partner portal experience, and run the North America rewards centre pilot as it rolls the refreshed programme out across its partner base.
