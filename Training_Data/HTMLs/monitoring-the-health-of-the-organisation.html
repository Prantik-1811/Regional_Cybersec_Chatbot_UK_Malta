Reject All Save My Preferences Accept All Powered by Reject All Save My Preferences Accept All Case Study Monitoring the Health of the Organisation Giulia Foss - 6 December 2023 Estimated reading time: 3 minutes How a Large Private Healthcare Provider Partnered With Reliance Cyber, to Ensure Robust Cyber Security and Peace of Mind . General Overview of the Customer The customer is one of the largest providers of private healthcare in the UK. Committed to the highest quality of patient care, they have earned a reputation as a leader in the field. The organisation has consistently delivered successful and award-winning clinical outcomes, positioning them well with patients, consultants, the NHS, GPs and Private Medical Insurers. The Situation The customer wanted to ensure it could demonstrate that privacy and personal data were treated with the same care and high standards as the patients themselves. They have a patient-focussed approach where reputation, service continuity, assurance and trust were identified essential requirements. This created a need for an environment where the digital landscape and infrastructure (systems, data and transit points) were trusted, verified and validated. The customer asked Reliance Cyber to provide a proposal for a Managed Security Monitoring solution, helping the organisation to detect attacks and then to enable and facilitate a rapid response. Our Solution The Reliance Cyber Managed Security Detection and Response (MDR) solution was deployed, enabling the client to achieve a robust Cyber security monitoring and response strategy. We worked with the customer in developing a prioritised roadmap of monitoring activities, creating security monitoring use cases and implementing an effective Security Analytics tool. This tooling ensures information assets and supporting technologies are adequately protected. Before deploying the solution, and as part of the on-boarding process, we performed a security review to understand the customer’s existing security posture and capabilities. Feedback was provided detailing the existing risks and the mitigations the MDR service would bring. During on-boarding, our analysts discovered an exploit which was relevant to the older systems within the customer’s environment. We addressed this immediately, providing protection to these systems. The Outcome The MDR service is now fully deployed and working well. We hold regular update meetings with the customer to refine the service, identify new risks and new systems coming into their environment which need to be added to the MDR service. The customer benefits from peace of mind, with access to our always on resources who can be contacted at any time to discuss issues and the performance of the service.
