News Article by Martin Anwyll, Cyber Security Sales Executive, CyberCrowd There’s something exciting about stepping into an event like TechEx Cyber Security & Cloud Expo at Olympia London. The scale of it, the hum of conversation between industry leaders, and the anticipation of uncovering the latest advancements in cyber security and cloud computing – it’s a world of innovation packed into two days. I attended on the 5th of February, and it was immediately clear that this was a well-attended event, with an array of vendors ranging from tech giants like Salesforce, KnowBe4, and TCS to ambitious one-man bands showcasing cutting-edge solutions. Across the exhibition floor, different areas were dedicated to IoT, AI, Automation, Cloud, DevOps, Sustainability, and, of course, Cyber Security. Each zone was buzzing with discussions, but if there was one standout attraction, it was AI. AI: The Buzz, The Uncertainty, and The Risk One observation was impossible to ignore – AI presentations were packed . Attendees were eager to explore its potential, but there was an underlying thread of uncertainty. Businesses are still figuring out how best to integrate AI tools like CoPilot into their environments while wrestling with the security implications. The message that stood out? AI is exposing risks that have long existed in data governance. Many organisations are only now realising that they lack clear visibility over their confidential data. Where is it stored? Who owns it? Who has access? And perhaps most crucially – what’s the context of this data? Without addressing these fundamental questions, businesses risk AI amplifying their security blind spots. A Deep Dive into Data Governance with Concentric AI One of the most insightful sessions I attended was led by Stephen Green, VP EMEA at Concentric AI . Concentric AI is an emerging player in the data governance space, mainly targeting large enterprises. Their solutions reinforce a growing need – companies require help with data classification, retention, and protection. The discussion aligned with a critical issue many businesses face: data sprawl. The more data organisations generate, the harder it becomes to manage. Without robust governance, sensitive information ends up in locations where it shouldn’t be, increasing exposure to breaches and regulatory non-compliance. The takeaway? Companies need to prioritise automated data classification and access controls to mitigate these risks effectively. At CyberCrowd , we see this first-hand. Many businesses lack clear data ownership and governance frameworks, making them vulnerable to threats. Our approach is to help organisations identify, classify, and protect their most sensitive data assets – ensuring security isn’t just a compliance exercise but a strategic business enabler. Cyber Security & The Human Element While some Cyber Security sessions required a paid pass to attend, I managed to catch snippets of some great discussions: What Looks Like Technology is Often Simply Human Behaviour – This session underscored a critical but often overlooked point: cyber security is as much about people as it is about technology. The biggest vulnerabilities often stem from human error – whether it’s phishing, misconfigurations, or poor security practices. Investing in awareness training and fostering a culture of security within an organisation is just as important as implementing the latest security tools. NetOps – The Fourth Musketeer – A fascinating discussion on how network operations teams play an increasingly vital role in cyber security, especially as infrastructure expands into multi-cloud environments. The talk explored the intersection between NetOps, DevOps, and SecOps and how collaboration between these teams can create a more resilient security posture. Panel Discussion: Evolving Threats, Evolving Roles – The CISO’s Future – This was one of the standout sessions for me. CISOs today are not just security gatekeepers; they are business enablers . The conversation focused on how security leaders must align their goals with broader business objectives – profitability, market share, customer satisfaction, innovation, and even sustainability. Security isn’t just about preventing attacks; it’s about driving measurable business value. Aligning Cyber Security with Business Strategy One of the key takeaways from the event was the need to align cyber security with wider business objectives. Too often, security is seen as a standalone function, separate from the rest of the business. But for cyber security to be truly effective, it needs to be embedded into strategic decision-making. Companies should be setting clear KPIs for cyber security – just as they do for revenue, customer retention, or product innovation. Metrics such as mean time to detect (MTTD), mean time to respond (MTTR), and percentage reduction in security incidents can provide tangible ways to track progress and demonstrate security’s impact on the business. At CyberCrowd , we work closely with organisations to ensure their security strategies are not just about protection but also about enabling business success . Whether it’s through penetration testing, incident response, or data governance, our goal is to help companies stay secure while maintaining agility and innovation. Final Thoughts TechEx Cyber Security & Cloud Expo was a great experience – an opportunity to engage with forward-thinking professionals, see emerging trends firsthand, and gain new insights into the evolving cyber security landscape. More than anything, the event reaffirmed that security isn’t just about technology – it’s about people, processes, and alignment with business goals. The industry is evolving rapidly, and those who integrate security into their core strategy will be the ones who stay ahead. A fantastic day of learning, networking, and thought-provoking discussions – I’m already looking forward to the next one!

The scale of it, the hum of conversation between industry leaders, and the anticipation of uncovering the latest advancements in cyber security and cloud computing – it’s a world of innovation packed into two days. I attended on the 5th of February, and it was immediately clear that this was a well-attended event, with an array of vendors ranging from tech giants like Salesforce, KnowBe4, and TCS to ambitious one-man bands showcasing cutting-edge solutions. Across the exhibition floor, different areas were dedicated to IoT, AI, Automation, Cloud, DevOps, Sustainability, and, of course, Cyber Security. Each zone was buzzing with discussions, but if there was one standout attraction, it was AI. AI: The Buzz, The Uncertainty, and The Risk One observation was impossible to ignore – AI presentations were packed . Attendees were eager to explore its potential, but there was an underlying thread of uncertainty. Businesses are still figuring out how best to integrate AI tools like CoPilot into their environments while wrestling with the security implications. The message that stood out? AI is exposing risks that have long existed in data governance. Many organisations are only now realising that they lack clear visibility over their confidential data. Where is it stored? Who owns it? Who has access? And perhaps most crucially – what’s the context of this data? Without addressing these fundamental questions, businesses risk AI amplifying their security blind spots. A Deep Dive into Data Governance with Concentric AI One of the most insightful sessions I attended was led by Stephen Green, VP EMEA at Concentric AI . Concentric AI is an emerging player in the data governance space, mainly targeting large enterprises. Their solutions reinforce a growing need – companies require help with data classification, retention, and protection. The discussion aligned with a critical issue many businesses face: data sprawl. The more data organisations generate, the harder it becomes to manage. Without robust governance, sensitive information ends up in locations where it shouldn’t be, increasing exposure to breaches and regulatory non-compliance. The takeaway? Companies need to prioritise automated data classification and access controls to mitigate these risks effectively. At CyberCrowd , we see this first-hand. Many businesses lack clear data ownership and governance frameworks, making them vulnerable to threats. Our approach is to help organisations identify, classify, and protect their most sensitive data assets – ensuring security isn’t just a compliance exercise but a strategic business enabler. Cyber Security & The Human Element While some Cyber Security sessions required a paid pass to attend, I managed to catch snippets of some great discussions: What Looks Like Technology is Often Simply Human Behaviour – This session underscored a critical but often overlooked point: cyber security is as much about people as it is about technology. The biggest vulnerabilities often stem from human error – whether it’s phishing, misconfigurations, or poor security practices. Investing in awareness training and fostering a culture of security within an organisation is just as important as implementing the latest security tools. NetOps – The Fourth Musketeer – A fascinating discussion on how network operations teams play an increasingly vital role in cyber security, especially as infrastructure expands into multi-cloud environments. The talk explored the intersection between NetOps, DevOps, and SecOps and how collaboration between these teams can create a more resilient security posture. Panel Discussion: Evolving Threats, Evolving Roles – The CISO’s Future – This was one of the standout sessions for me. CISOs today are not just security gatekeepers; they are business enablers . The conversation focused on how security leaders must align their goals with broader business objectives – profitability, market share, customer satisfaction, innovation, and even sustainability. Security isn’t just about preventing attacks; it’s about driving measurable business value. Aligning Cyber Security with Business Strategy One of the key takeaways from the event was the need to align cyber security with wider business objectives. Too often, security is seen as a standalone function, separate from the rest of the business. But for cyber security to be truly effective, it needs to be embedded into strategic decision-making. Companies should be setting clear KPIs for cyber security – just as they do for revenue, customer retention, or product innovation. Metrics such as mean time to detect (MTTD), mean time to respond (MTTR), and percentage reduction in security incidents can provide tangible ways to track progress and demonstrate security’s impact on the business. At CyberCrowd , we work closely with organisations to ensure their security strategies are not just about protection but also about enabling business success . Whether it’s through penetration testing, incident response, or data governance, our goal is to help companies stay secure while maintaining agility and innovation. Final Thoughts TechEx Cyber Security & Cloud Expo was a great experience – an opportunity to engage with forward-thinking professionals, see emerging trends firsthand, and gain new insights into the evolving cyber security landscape. More than anything, the event reaffirmed that security isn’t just about technology – it’s about people, processes, and alignment with business goals. The industry is evolving rapidly, and those who integrate security into their core strategy will be the ones who stay ahead.
