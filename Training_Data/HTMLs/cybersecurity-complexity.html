Reject All Save My Preferences Accept All Powered by Reject All Save My Preferences Accept All Blog Post The Good, the Bad and the Ugly: 2024 Edition “Cybersecurity Complexity” Reliance Cyber - 20 December 2024 Estimated reading time: 6 minutes Contents The Bad The Ugly The Good Steps to Simplify Cybersecurity Conclusion While growing up, my parents never owned a VCR player, so I had to go around my uncle’s house to watch movies. He was a big fan of Westerns, and I probably watched The Good, the Bad and the Ugly more than 20 times during my childhood. When deciding on a title for this article, I couldn’t help but think of how fitting it would be. The Bad We live in an era where VCR players are relics, and digital threats evolve daily. The rapid proliferation of AI and machine learning (ML) technologies across the cybersecurity landscape, employed by both defenders and attackers, dominates much of the current dialogue across Cybersecurity professionals. Organisations often respond to these challenges by deploying increasingly complex cybersecurity systems. But is implementing intricate systems always the best approach to addressing sophisticated threats? In many cases, these overly complex solutions can do more harm than good if not deployed correctly. Simplicity in cybersecurity design is not analogous to weak security, it’s essential for businesses aiming to maintain robust defenses while ensuring operational efficiency. One significant concern is vulnerability identification and exposure. While advances in technology have made vulnerability identification more efficient, there is often insufficient testing applied by vendors and software developers to their products before releasing it. Regardless, maintaining secure systems that can protect against known and zero-day vulnerabilities is now more critical than ever for organisations. The Ugly Complex systems require substantial resources to manage and maintain. They often demand specialised expertise, continuous training, and frequent updates, all of which can strain IT teams and budgets. Some of the main issues that can arise are covered below: Overwhelmed Support Teams: Managing multiple systems can inundate support teams with alerts and tickets, making it challenging to provide effective security. Frustrated End Users: When systems are overly complex, users may feel like they need an IT degree to complete basic tasks. Technology should empower users, not hinder them. False Sense of Security: Complex systems that do not integrate or communicate effectively with one another can leave gaps, making threat detection and mitigation more difficult. Increased Risk of Human Error: Complexity heightens the likelihood of errors during day-to-day operations, especially when integrating new technologies or troubleshooting. The Good Overcomplicating systems can leave organisations in a state of paralysis, a “Mexican standoff” where no one knows what the next move should be. Simple cybersecurity solutions offer numerous benefits: Ease of Monitoring and Maintenance: Simpler systems are easier to monitor, troubleshoot, and update, saving time and money while enforcing defined policies. Improved IT Efficiency: A streamlined approach reduces the cost of training and resource allocation, enabling teams to focus on mastering fewer platforms. Scalability and Adaptability: Simple systems are easier to scale and adapt to dynamic workloads, whether it’s expanding to new locations, up-scaling compute resource, or adding users. Steps to Simplify Cybersecurity If you’ve read this far, take a moment to reflect: “Am I in a Mexican standoff, and what will be my next move?” Here are some recommendations to simplify your cybersecurity strategy: 1. Audit Your Organisation Perform a comprehensive audit to identify, classify, and assess all cybersecurity elements. Though it may seem daunting, this foundational step is critical for creating a “keep it simple” roadmap. Key actions include: Identify Assets: Determine what data, devices, and systems need protection. Identify Vulnerabilities: Deploy a vulnerability and patch management system to identify and manage risks. Make sure that vulnerable assets are patched or isolated. Assess Threat Levels: Evaluate your organisation’s external threat exposure (e.g., domains, emails). Prioritise Risks: Focus on high-risk areas, such as sensitive data, Internet-exposed services or critical systems. 2. Leverage Workshops to build a Roadmap plan Workshops and roadmaps are essential for long-term planning. Too often, organisations address short-term needs without considering the bigger picture, leading to future complications. Always plan for simplicity, scalability, and remember that cybersecurity and business needs are constantly evolving. Cybersecurity is a journey rather than a project. Always validate that whatever security systems you use do meet your requirements. Do proof of concepts and have a clear set of requirements and deliverables. Ensuring that the solution is fit for purpose is critical before investing time and money. 3. Embrace the Long View Simplifying cybersecurity may seem like a monumental challenge, but it’s achievable with careful planning. The rewards are worth the effort: Cost Efficiency: Simplified systems reduce licensing fees, integration challenges, and staffing requirements, freeing resources for other business priorities. Improved Scalability: Straightforward solutions adapt better to growth and technological advancements. Enhanced Compliance: Well-documented, simple systems streamline audits and regulatory compliance. Conclusion I hope this article has demonstrated that complexity is not synonymous with strength. By prioritising simplicity, businesses can build cybersecurity systems that are effective, efficient, and adaptable. If you have a shortage of resources or expertise for this transformation, feel free to reach out to us. With years of experience across diverse industries and challenges, we’re confident we can help your organisation achieve your goals.

Leverage Workshops to build a Roadmap plan Workshops and roadmaps are essential for long-term planning. Too often, organisations address short-term needs without considering the bigger picture, leading to future complications. Always plan for simplicity, scalability, and remember that cybersecurity and business needs are constantly evolving. Cybersecurity is a journey rather than a project. Always validate that whatever security systems you use do meet your requirements. Do proof of concepts and have a clear set of requirements and deliverables. Ensuring that the solution is fit for purpose is critical before investing time and money. 3. Embrace the Long View Simplifying cybersecurity may seem like a monumental challenge, but it’s achievable with careful planning. The rewards are worth the effort: Cost Efficiency: Simplified systems reduce licensing fees, integration challenges, and staffing requirements, freeing resources for other business priorities. Improved Scalability: Straightforward solutions adapt better to growth and technological advancements. Enhanced Compliance: Well-documented, simple systems streamline audits and regulatory compliance. Conclusion I hope this article has demonstrated that complexity is not synonymous with strength. By prioritising simplicity, businesses can build cybersecurity systems that are effective, efficient, and adaptable.

He was a big fan of Westerns, and I probably watched The Good, the Bad and the Ugly more than 20 times during my childhood. When deciding on a title for this article, I couldn’t help but think of how fitting it would be. The Bad We live in an era where VCR players are relics, and digital threats evolve daily. The rapid proliferation of AI and machine learning (ML) technologies across the cybersecurity landscape, employed by both defenders and attackers, dominates much of the current dialogue across Cybersecurity professionals. Organisations often respond to these challenges by deploying increasingly complex cybersecurity systems. But is implementing intricate systems always the best approach to addressing sophisticated threats? In many cases, these overly complex solutions can do more harm than good if not deployed correctly. Simplicity in cybersecurity design is not analogous to weak security, it’s essential for businesses aiming to maintain robust defenses while ensuring operational efficiency. One significant concern is vulnerability identification and exposure. While advances in technology have made vulnerability identification more efficient, there is often insufficient testing applied by vendors and software developers to their products before releasing it. Regardless, maintaining secure systems that can protect against known and zero-day vulnerabilities is now more critical than ever for organisations. The Ugly Complex systems require substantial resources to manage and maintain. They often demand specialised expertise, continuous training, and frequent updates, all of which can strain IT teams and budgets. Some of the main issues that can arise are covered below: Overwhelmed Support Teams: Managing multiple systems can inundate support teams with alerts and tickets, making it challenging to provide effective security. Frustrated End Users: When systems are overly complex, users may feel like they need an IT degree to complete basic tasks. Technology should empower users, not hinder them. False Sense of Security: Complex systems that do not integrate or communicate effectively with one another can leave gaps, making threat detection and mitigation more difficult. Increased Risk of Human Error: Complexity heightens the likelihood of errors during day-to-day operations, especially when integrating new technologies or troubleshooting. The Good Overcomplicating systems can leave organisations in a state of paralysis, a “Mexican standoff” where no one knows what the next move should be. Simple cybersecurity solutions offer numerous benefits: Ease of Monitoring and Maintenance: Simpler systems are easier to monitor, troubleshoot, and update, saving time and money while enforcing defined policies. Improved IT Efficiency: A streamlined approach reduces the cost of training and resource allocation, enabling teams to focus on mastering fewer platforms. Scalability and Adaptability: Simple systems are easier to scale and adapt to dynamic workloads, whether it’s expanding to new locations, up-scaling compute resource, or adding users. Steps to Simplify Cybersecurity If you’ve read this far, take a moment to reflect: “Am I in a Mexican standoff, and what will be my next move?” Here are some recommendations to simplify your cybersecurity strategy: 1. Audit Your Organisation Perform a comprehensive audit to identify, classify, and assess all cybersecurity elements. Though it may seem daunting, this foundational step is critical for creating a “keep it simple” roadmap. Key actions include: Identify Assets: Determine what data, devices, and systems need protection. Identify Vulnerabilities: Deploy a vulnerability and patch management system to identify and manage risks. Make sure that vulnerable assets are patched or isolated. Assess Threat Levels: Evaluate your organisation’s external threat exposure (e.g., domains, emails). Prioritise Risks: Focus on high-risk areas, such as sensitive data, Internet-exposed services or critical systems. 2.
