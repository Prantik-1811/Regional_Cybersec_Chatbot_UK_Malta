Pen Testing In an era where cyber threats continue to evolve, educational institutions must remain vigilant in protecting their IT infrastructure and sensitive data. Northampton College, one of the UK’s largest further education providers, recently took proactive steps to enhance its cybersecurity resilience and meet compliance requirements. Meeting the IT Security Challenge As part of an Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) mandate , Northampton College was required to complete a comprehensive IT Health Check (ITHC) to assess and strengthen its security posture. Like many large educational institutions, the College faced cybersecurity challenges such as: Protecting sensitive student and staff data Managing a complex IT network across multiple campuses Mitigating risks from outdated software and unpatched systems Securing network access for staff, students, and visitors Recognising the need for expert support , Northampton College partnered with Celerity and CyberCrowd , leveraging CREST-approved penetration testing and vulnerability scanning to identify and mitigate potential security risks. A Collaborative Approach to Cybersecurity With CyberCrowd as an NCSC Level 2 Assured Service Provider , the ITHC was conducted efficiently and seamlessly , minimising disruption to college operations. The assessment covered: External & Internal Infrastructure Testing – Identifying vulnerabilities in networks, firewalls, and servers Wi-Fi Security Assessment – Ensuring secure access points across campus Firewall Configuration Review – Strengthening security rules and access controls Device & Server Security Analysis – Addressing software updates and configuration gaps Andy Seymour, ICT Services Manager at Northampton College, emphasised the importance of regular security assessments: “In today’s digital age, ensuring the security and integrity of our IT infrastructure is paramount. Regular testing and compliance checks are essential to maintain our high standards and protect our community.” Key Outcomes: Strengthened Security & Compliance The penetration testing and vulnerability scans identified several key security gaps, allowing Northampton College’s IT team to address them immediately. Through CyberCrowd’s Client Pen Test Portal , the College gained real-time insights into test results, risk assessments, and tailored remediation strategies. As a result, Northampton College: Improved its security posture and reduced exposure to cyber threats Enhanced its ability to detect and manage future incidents Aligned with best practices for cybersecurity compliance Read the Full Case Study Northampton College’s proactive approach to cybersecurity highlights the critical role of regular security assessments in education.
