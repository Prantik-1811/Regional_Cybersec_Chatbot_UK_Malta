Microsoft Sentinel Microsoft Sentinel is a lightweight SIEM with low barrier to entry costing model, we recommend this for customers that are just starting out in the SIEM space with typically smaller environments to cover. We’ve mastered the installation and configuration process – making it easy for our customers to quickly get up and running. We can provide bespoke reporting solutions for C-Level executives and security framework compliance reporting for security experts Born in the cloud, we have a deep understanding of data science technologies and a pedigree in security frameworks, compliance, and auditing. Sentinel allows for seamless integration between other Microsoft products to allow for companies going Microsoft first or sitting in Azure cloud to have a very short setup time for time to value from the SIEM. We are an amalgamation of experienced Security Consultants, Network Engineers, and Data Scientists. Together we’ve mastered the Microsoft Sentinel platform, providing a perfect blend of security and data expertise. Design & Installation We help you quickly design and deploy your Azure Sentinel environment. Managed Service We can manage your SIEM environment ensuring it is always providing value. CISO Dashboard Our tailored dashboards will give the right information to different stakeholders in your organisation. Security & Compliance Our certified consultants will help you deploy your environment for different compliance frameworks such as PCI or GDPR. Configuration Review Our consultants can review your configuration to ensure you are always compliant and getting the alerts and notifications you need. Automation & ML Our Data Scientists create automation to look for breach behaviour and automatically alert and circumvent. Each of our customers have different environments with varying levels of security devices that need monitoring. Once these devices are loaded onto the SIEM it’s our job to create, fine tune and customise a ruleset that is tailored specifically for your environment. Aiding our analysts when investigations into these alarms take place, less time is spent searching through unnecessary logs and we can be proactive in our approach to mitigate these alarms. // CONTACT DETAILS Contact Us Please fill in the form below and a member of the CyberCrowd team will get back to you, we endeavour to answer all enquires within 24 hours on business days.
