SecurityBrief UK - Technology news for CISOs & cybersecurity decision-makers United Kingdom Guides # cloud security # cybersecurity # endpoint protection # firewalls # ransomware Search # Data Protection # Digital Transformation # Phishing Hubtel urges agile Cyber Bill to tackle rising AI threats Mon, 2nd Feb 2026 By Sofiah Nichole Salivio, News Editor Hubtel IT has urged the Government to ensure that the proposed Cyber Security & Resilience Bill evolves in tandem with advancements in artificial intelligence. The firm warned that regulatory frameworks failing to adapt to the rapid pace of technological change could inadvertently stifle business adoption and hinder economic growth. The West Midlands-based IT specialist raised these concerns during a visit by Rachel Taylor MP to the company's headquarters in Nether Whitacre, near Birmingham. Taylor, who represents the North Warwickshire and Bedworth constituency, met with the team to discuss the balance between robust digital security and the need for a regulatory environment that supports innovation within the UK's tech sector. Hubtel IT Chief Executive Neil Bayliss said the legislation needs flexibility as AI develops beyond consumer chat tools. He said companies now deploy more advanced automation in business processes and cyber criminals increasingly use AI in attacks. "Britain's new Cyber Bill must be agile and adaptive, keeping pace with rapid AI-driven advancements that are evolving far beyond simple chat tools and into powerful agentic automations delivering transformative business efficiency and growth," said Neil Bayliss, Chief Executive, Hubtel IT. Bayliss also called for a closer working relationship between policymakers and specialists in the sector. "We need real pragmatism from those at the helm together with real trust in us, the industry experts at the frontier of harnessing the power of AI into our clients' business processes and combating the ever-evolving threat of AI-enabled cyber criminals," said Bayliss. The Cyber Security & Resilience Bill is moving through readings in the House of Commons. It will then go to the House of Lords later this year before it becomes law. Rising threat Hubtel IT has highlighted the severity of the digital threat landscape, noting that the United Kingdom now experiences an average of four major cyberattack-related incidents every week. The firm described cybercrime as a relentless, evolving threat that necessitates a sophisticated, around-the-clock response to protect critical infrastructure and corporate data. Over the past year, cybersecurity has moved to the forefront of the corporate agenda as high-profile attacks have increasingly targeted large employers and their complex supply chains. During her visit, Rachel Taylor MP cited the recent cyberattack against Jaguar Land Rover as a primary example of the "domino effect," illustrating how a single security breach can ripple outward to affect numerous interconnected partners and suppliers. This trend underscores the urgent need for the Government's legislative framework to address systemic vulnerabilities across entire industrial ecosystems. "West Midlands firms like Hubtel IT are leading the way when it comes to ensuring businesses can reap the benefits and protect themselves against the threats posed by new technologies," said Rachel Taylor, MP for North Warwickshire and Bedworth. "As the recent cyberattack against Jaguar Land Rover shows, these attacks can cause real damage not just to individual businesses, but to whole communities," said Taylor. "It was a real treat to meet with Neil and the team at Hubtel IT in Whitacre Heath and learn more about the vital work they are doing keeping us all protected in our increasingly digital world," said Taylor. Local expansion Hubtel IT said it has expanded its headcount as it invests in an AI-led growth plan. Bayliss founded the company in 2002 from his parents' home in Hall Green, Birmingham. The firm recently hired three employees: Marketing Manager Craig Potts, Tech Help Desk Manager Michelle Loveland, and IT Support Engineer Jake Barwell. Hubtel IT said the hires represent a 25% increase in staffing and take its total workforce to 15. Bayliss said organisations need to treat cyber security as a management and workforce issue, alongside technology decisions. He described AI as a risk factor and a potential tool for businesses. "Cybersecurity is as much about culture and awareness as it is about tech, and AI is the key risk as well as the key opportunity. It's being used by cyber criminals, but it can also be harnessed by many businesses to drive growth, improve productivity and create more efficient ways of working," said Bayliss. AI and people Bayliss said businesses that rely on existing methods may struggle to keep pace with changes in automation and attacker tactics. He said companies are now assessing how AI can change internal workflows and decision-making. "Traditional processes can only take you so far. Now is the time for AI to elevate those processes to a higher level of automation, giving businesses and their employees the opportunity to focus more on strategy, efficiency and long-term growth," said Bayliss. He also pointed to the growth of AI-driven social engineering, which targets individuals as well as corporate systems. He said this increases the importance of employee awareness and vigilance. "In 2025 many businesses, including big brands like JLR and M&S, fell victim to cyberattacks. While organisations continue strengthening their system defences, the rise of AI-driven social engineering means individuals are increasingly being targeted, so each of us must be vigilant," said Bayliss.

It's being used by cyber criminals, but it can also be harnessed by many businesses to drive growth, improve productivity and create more efficient ways of working," said Bayliss. Bayliss said businesses that rely on existing methods may struggle to keep pace with changes in automation and attacker tactics. He said companies are now assessing how AI can change internal workflows and decision-making. "Traditional processes can only take you so far. Now is the time for AI to elevate those processes to a higher level of automation, giving businesses and their employees the opportunity to focus more on strategy, efficiency and long-term growth," said Bayliss. He also pointed to the growth of AI-driven social engineering, which targets individuals as well as corporate systems. He said this increases the importance of employee awareness and vigilance. "In 2025 many businesses, including big brands like JLR and M&S, fell victim to cyberattacks. While organisations continue strengthening their system defences, the rise of AI-driven social engineering means individuals are increasingly being targeted, so each of us must be vigilant," said Bayliss.
