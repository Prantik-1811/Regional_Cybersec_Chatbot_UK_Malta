News As we step into 2025, the UK cybersecurity landscape has seen several major events and developments. Here’s a roundup of five key cybersecurity news stories from January 2025, along with actionable insights for businesses. 1. Rising Cybercrime Risks Amid AI Advancements At the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, experts highlighted the escalating threat of cybercrime, exacerbated by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). The Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2025 report emphasised that geopolitical tensions are leading to increased cyberattacks on businesses and governments. The complexity of supply chains further amplifies these risks. Caroline Escott of Railpen noted that cyber risks are a growing concern for investors, affecting sectors like healthcare, financial services, and energy. Paul Webber of BlackBerry pointed out that AI is expanding the “attack surface,” enabling more sophisticated attacks. Despite these warnings, a sense of complacency persists among companies, with expectations often misaligned with the reality of potential financial and reputational losses from cyberattacks. Actionable Insight: Businesses should reassess their cybersecurity strategies, considering the evolving threats posed by AI. Implementing advanced threat detection systems and fostering a culture of continuous vigilance are crucial steps toward enhancing cyber resilience. 2. Government Departments Face Severe Cyber-Attack Threats The National Audit Office (NAO) warned that UK government departments are confronting severe and rapidly advancing cyber-attack threats. An assessment of 58 critical government IT systems in 2024 revealed significant vulnerabilities, with an additional 228 legacy systems potentially at risk. Recent attacks on institutions like the British Library and NHS foundation trusts underscore the urgency of the situation. The NAO criticised senior civil servants for not prioritising cyber-resilience, leading to inadequate investment and staffing. The increasing digitisation of government services heightens the risk of disruptive cyber-attacks from adversaries such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. The report highlights the need to address the shortage of cyber skills, improve accountability for cyber risks, and manage legacy IT systems to protect public services. Actionable Insight: Organisations, both public and private, must prioritise updating and securing legacy IT systems. Investing in cybersecurity training and addressing skill shortages are essential to building a robust defence against evolving threats. 3. Smiths Group Suffers Global Cyberattack Smiths Group, a global engineering and technology conglomerate, experienced a worldwide cyberattack resulting in unauthorised access to its systems. The company promptly isolated the affected systems and activated business continuity plans, collaborating with cybersecurity experts to assess and recover from the incident. The attack led to a 1.7% drop in the company’s share price. Smiths Group operates across various sectors, including satellite connectivity, security screening components, and the oil and gas industry. While the company has not disclosed any ransom demands or data losses, the incident highlights ongoing cybersecurity challenges faced by corporations. It emphasises the importance of robust defences and board-level attention to cybersecurity risks. Actionable Insight: Businesses should develop and regularly test incident response and business continuity plans. Engaging with cybersecurity experts for proactive assessments can help identify vulnerabilities and strengthen defences. 4. Government Launches £1.9 Million Initiative to Boost Cyber Resilience The UK government announced a £1.9 million initiative to enhance the nation’s cyber resilience. More than 30 projects across England and Northern Ireland will receive funding to deliver targeted support, including training to boost cyber skills and new methods to protect businesses against cyber threats. These schemes aim to protect the UK’s digital economy and grow a pipeline of cyber talent. Projects include initiatives to strengthen local business resilience, encourage more young people into cybersecurity careers, support neurodiverse talent, and upskill small business workers. A project in the West Midlands will focus on supporting women and girls to protect them from cyber-related violence and abuse. Actionable Insight: Businesses should explore opportunities to participate in or support local cybersecurity initiatives. Investing in community-based projects can help build a diverse and skilled cyber workforce, benefiting the broader economy. 5. Cybersecurity Skills Shortage Persists Despite various initiatives, the UK continues to face a significant cybersecurity skills shortage. Estimates indicate that the UK’s cyber workforce gap grew by 27% annually, reaching over 93,000 positions in 2024. This shortage poses challenges for both public and private sectors in maintaining robust cybersecurity defences. The government and industry partners are fostering robust and diverse cyber communities to address this issue. Actionable Insight : Organisations should invest in training and development programs to upskill existing employees in cybersecurity. Partnering with educational institutions to create apprenticeship and internship opportunities can also help bridge the skills gap. Additionally, working with cybersecurity partners who provide Experts-as-a-Service offers businesses access to specialist skills and knowledge exactly when they need them, without the overhead of full-time hires. Summary The cybersecurity landscape in the UK is becoming increasingly complex, with advancements in technology and evolving threats presenting significant challenges. Businesses must remain vigilant, proactively updating their cybersecurity measures, investing in skills development, and participating in broader initiatives to enhance resilience. By staying informed and taking decisive action, organisations can navigate the dynamic cybersecurity environment and protect their operations against emerging threats.

Here’s a roundup of five key cybersecurity news stories from January 2025, along with actionable insights for businesses. 1. Rising Cybercrime Risks Amid AI Advancements At the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, experts highlighted the escalating threat of cybercrime, exacerbated by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). The Global Cybersecurity Outlook 2025 report emphasised that geopolitical tensions are leading to increased cyberattacks on businesses and governments. The complexity of supply chains further amplifies these risks. Caroline Escott of Railpen noted that cyber risks are a growing concern for investors, affecting sectors like healthcare, financial services, and energy. Paul Webber of BlackBerry pointed out that AI is expanding the “attack surface,” enabling more sophisticated attacks. Despite these warnings, a sense of complacency persists among companies, with expectations often misaligned with the reality of potential financial and reputational losses from cyberattacks. Actionable Insight: Businesses should reassess their cybersecurity strategies, considering the evolving threats posed by AI. Implementing advanced threat detection systems and fostering a culture of continuous vigilance are crucial steps toward enhancing cyber resilience. 2. Government Departments Face Severe Cyber-Attack Threats The National Audit Office (NAO) warned that UK government departments are confronting severe and rapidly advancing cyber-attack threats. An assessment of 58 critical government IT systems in 2024 revealed significant vulnerabilities, with an additional 228 legacy systems potentially at risk. Recent attacks on institutions like the British Library and NHS foundation trusts underscore the urgency of the situation. The NAO criticised senior civil servants for not prioritising cyber-resilience, leading to inadequate investment and staffing. The increasing digitisation of government services heightens the risk of disruptive cyber-attacks from adversaries such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. The report highlights the need to address the shortage of cyber skills, improve accountability for cyber risks, and manage legacy IT systems to protect public services. Actionable Insight: Organisations, both public and private, must prioritise updating and securing legacy IT systems. Investing in cybersecurity training and addressing skill shortages are essential to building a robust defence against evolving threats. 3. Smiths Group Suffers Global Cyberattack Smiths Group, a global engineering and technology conglomerate, experienced a worldwide cyberattack resulting in unauthorised access to its systems. The company promptly isolated the affected systems and activated business continuity plans, collaborating with cybersecurity experts to assess and recover from the incident. The attack led to a 1.7% drop in the company’s share price. Smiths Group operates across various sectors, including satellite connectivity, security screening components, and the oil and gas industry. While the company has not disclosed any ransom demands or data losses, the incident highlights ongoing cybersecurity challenges faced by corporations. It emphasises the importance of robust defences and board-level attention to cybersecurity risks. Actionable Insight: Businesses should develop and regularly test incident response and business continuity plans. Engaging with cybersecurity experts for proactive assessments can help identify vulnerabilities and strengthen defences. 4. Government Launches £1.9 Million Initiative to Boost Cyber Resilience The UK government announced a £1.9 million initiative to enhance the nation’s cyber resilience. More than 30 projects across England and Northern Ireland will receive funding to deliver targeted support, including training to boost cyber skills and new methods to protect businesses against cyber threats. These schemes aim to protect the UK’s digital economy and grow a pipeline of cyber talent. Projects include initiatives to strengthen local business resilience, encourage more young people into cybersecurity careers, support neurodiverse talent, and upskill small business workers. A project in the West Midlands will focus on supporting women and girls to protect them from cyber-related violence and abuse. Actionable Insight: Businesses should explore opportunities to participate in or support local cybersecurity initiatives. Investing in community-based projects can help build a diverse and skilled cyber workforce, benefiting the broader economy. 5. Cybersecurity Skills Shortage Persists Despite various initiatives, the UK continues to face a significant cybersecurity skills shortage. Estimates indicate that the UK’s cyber workforce gap grew by 27% annually, reaching over 93,000 positions in 2024. This shortage poses challenges for both public and private sectors in maintaining robust cybersecurity defences. The government and industry partners are fostering robust and diverse cyber communities to address this issue. Actionable Insight : Organisations should invest in training and development programs to upskill existing employees in cybersecurity. Partnering with educational institutions to create apprenticeship and internship opportunities can also help bridge the skills gap. Additionally, working with cybersecurity partners who provide Experts-as-a-Service offers businesses access to specialist skills and knowledge exactly when they need them, without the overhead of full-time hires.
