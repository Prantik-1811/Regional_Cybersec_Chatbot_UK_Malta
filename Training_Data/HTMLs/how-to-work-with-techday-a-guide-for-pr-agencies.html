ChannelLife UK - Industry insider news for technology resellers United Kingdom Guides # cloud services # cybersecurity # distributors # microsoft # partner programmes Search # Partner Programmes # Marketing # TechDay How to work with TechDay: A guide for PR Agencies Tue, 17th Dec 2024 FYI, this story is more than a year old By Sean Mitchell, Publisher Our mission is to deliver fast and efficient news, focusing primarily on technology, finance & marketing arenas. To help you work with our editorial team, we've prepared this guide. Following these guidelines will maximise your chances of having your press releases published while making our lives easier. General guidelines These are our top tips for press releases: 1. Send to the correct address All press releases must be sent to editors@techday.com. Submissions to individual editors are not be considered. 2. Subject lines matter Write clear, descriptive subject lines that include the brand and announcement. Avoid vague lines like "Our press release" or "News for TechDay", etc. 3. Embed text in the email Include everything you would like us to consider directly in the body of the email. Linked or attached documents are not considered. 4. Length requirements Ensure your press release is at least 650 words. Releases with fewer words will not be considered. This ensures we have enough material to craft a 400 (or more) word story that meets our standards. 5. Regional versions You can submit separate versions of the same release if you have regional-specific statistics or quotes. These should be in separate emails and specify the region in the subject line. 6. Include all assets in the initial email We're looking for permanent images for stories. Attach photos or link to them in your initial email. Follow-up emails to add images or additional images will not be reviewed. They should exceed our minimum 1200 width and 677 height pixels size. If no image is available, there is no need to send stock photography. 7. Quotes Releases need to include supporting quotes. 8. Separate Multiple Announcements For conferences or multiple announcements, send each as a separate email. This helps our editors allocate them effectively and ensures none are overlooked. Content types we accept In addition to general news and announcements, we also accept: 1. Comments Short, timely expert comments (approximately 120 words) on industry events or breaking news. We wait until we have received three of these expert comments on a topic to write a combined story. If multiple experts are available, each is welcome as separate emails or combined. 2. Appointments and job moves These stories are highly valuable. Be sure to include a professional headshot; submissions without one will be rejected. 3. Event transcripts Share transcripts from your events. We're open to experimenting with these as a potential story source. What to avoid These are our top requests to avoid: 1. Follow-ups Avoid emailing or calling to confirm receipt, inquire about the coverage status, or to follow us up. We operate a zero inbox, so all releases sent to editors@techday.com are reviewed. We also regularly check our spam folders. 2. Prohibited topics We do not publish stories about cryptocurrencies, NFTs, aviation, or the power industry unless they are directly IT-related. 3. Regions we don't cover We don't cover stories specific to the Middle East, Africa or South America. So save everyone time and don't send them. 4. Unnecessary emails Do not email asking if we would like a press release. Simply send it. 5. Detailed reports Presentations, detailed reports or whitepapers must be summarised into a release format as we rarely have time otherwise. 6. Attachments or links Avoid sending PDFs or Word documents, which can introduce formatting issues or uncertainty about tracked changes. Linked press releases or blogs are not considered, as the links change over time, and we need to maintain the source document for legal reasons. 7. Embargoed releases Avoid embargoes unless absolutely necessary. Embargoed releases often go unpublished due to timing misalignment with our Editorial team's weekly targets. Support TechDay When we publish your story, it reflects significant editorial effort and cost to our business. We receive no advertising or reader revenue, so we succeed when people like you support us financially. You can purchase sponsored content or become an ongoing partner with us.
