News At CyberCrowd, we’re always looking to deepen our expertise and ensure we’re providing the best advice to our customers. This week, Martin Anwyll, Cyber Security Sales Executive , had the opportunity to attend Cyber Essentials training, led by Stuart Allen at IASME. It was a great session that reinforced just how vital Cyber Essentials (CE) is in today’s evolving threat landscape. Here are some key takeaways: Why Cyber Essentials Matters More Than Ever Cyber Essentials is a government-backed scheme designed to help businesses protect themselves against common cyber threats. It has grown significantly in recent years, with over 50,000 certifications issued last year alone – an impressive 75% increase in enquiries. This surge is largely driven by new government policies, reinforcing the importance of cybersecurity in the supply chain. Many organisations, particularly those bidding for government contracts, now require CE certification. But it’s not just for SMEs anymore – large enterprises are increasingly pushing their suppliers to obtain CE, recognising the role it plays in securing their entire ecosystem. Key Takeaways for Our Customers 1. Cyber Insurance Benefits One of the standout benefits of Cyber Essentials is the built-in cyber insurance for eligible organisations, offering up to £25,000 of coverage at no additional cost (if opted in at the application stage). This can cover incident response, regulatory fines, downtime compensation, and even ransom payments. For organisations with a UK-based turnover of less than £20m, this is an excellent safety net. One real-world example was a shipping organisation that saved £8,000 on their cyber insurance premium simply by obtaining CE certification – making it a financially savvy investment as well as a security necessity. 2. CE Readiness Tool – A Useful Gap Analysis Resource IASME offers a free Readiness Tool to help businesses assess their current cybersecurity posture against CE requirements. While the current version has room for improvement, a more user-friendly update is on the way. If you’re considering CE certification, this tool can provide a good starting point. 3. Knowledge Hub – Ongoing Support and Updates The IASME Knowledge Hub is a valuable resource for staying up to date with cybersecurity developments. It provides key information, such as operating system end-of-life dates . IASME also runs monthly webinars to keep organisations informed about emerging threats and best practices. 4. The Growing Role of Cyber Essentials Beyond SME’s While CE has traditionally been seen as an SME-focused certification, the landscape is shifting. Large enterprises and government bodies are now mandating Cyber Essentials for their supply chain , recognising that even small vulnerabilities can pose significant risks. If you work with major clients, achieving CE certification could soon become a prerequisite for doing business. 5. Why Choose CyberCrowd as Your Cyber Essentials Partner?

This week, Martin Anwyll, Cyber Security Sales Executive , had the opportunity to attend Cyber Essentials training, led by Stuart Allen at IASME. It was a great session that reinforced just how vital Cyber Essentials (CE) is in today’s evolving threat landscape. Here are some key takeaways: Why Cyber Essentials Matters More Than Ever Cyber Essentials is a government-backed scheme designed to help businesses protect themselves against common cyber threats. It has grown significantly in recent years, with over 50,000 certifications issued last year alone – an impressive 75% increase in enquiries. This surge is largely driven by new government policies, reinforcing the importance of cybersecurity in the supply chain. Many organisations, particularly those bidding for government contracts, now require CE certification. But it’s not just for SMEs anymore – large enterprises are increasingly pushing their suppliers to obtain CE, recognising the role it plays in securing their entire ecosystem. Key Takeaways for Our Customers 1. Cyber Insurance Benefits One of the standout benefits of Cyber Essentials is the built-in cyber insurance for eligible organisations, offering up to £25,000 of coverage at no additional cost (if opted in at the application stage). This can cover incident response, regulatory fines, downtime compensation, and even ransom payments. For organisations with a UK-based turnover of less than £20m, this is an excellent safety net.
