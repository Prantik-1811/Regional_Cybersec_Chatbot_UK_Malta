News In the past months, we have seen a huge increase in phishing emails targeting organisations across all sectors. What once might have seemed like a rare nuisance is now one of the most prevalent and dangerous cyber threats faced today. But what exactly is phishing – and why is it such a growing problem? What Is Phishing? Phishing is a cyberattack technique where attackers impersonate trusted sources to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, clicking on malicious links, or downloading harmful attachments. It often arrives disguised as seemingly legitimate emails, messages, or even phone calls. What makes phishing especially dangerous today is how sophisticated it has become. Gone are the days of obvious spelling mistakes or clumsy grammar. Modern phishing emails often feature: Well-crafted language Genuine-looking logos and formatting Realistic sender addresses (sometimes mimicking real contacts) Contextually relevant content tailored to the target organisation Because of this, phishing remains one of the most effective methods for attackers to breach organisations, steal data, or deliver ransomware. The Scale of the Threat According to the UK Government’s Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2025 , phishing remains the most commonly identified cyber threat , with 84% of medium businesses and 91% of large businesses reporting phishing attempts in the past 12 months. It’s the leading attack vector reported across sectors, often acting as the entry point for more serious breaches such as ransomware or business email compromise. Despite growing awareness, phishing continues to be both widespread and highly effective. For organisations, falling victim to a phishing attack can lead to compromised credentials, financial loss, damaged reputation, and costly downtime. Spotting Phishing Emails: What to Look Out For Recognising phishing attempts is the first step in defending against them. While attacks grow more sophisticated, there are still some telltale signs you can watch for: Weird Domains: Emails from addresses that look similar but are slightly off – like “@yourbank-secure.com” instead of “@yourbank.com” – are a classic red flag. Always double-check the sender’s domain. Odd Invite or Meeting Requests: Unexpected meeting invitations or calendar requests from unknown senders, or unusual meeting details from known contacts, can be an attempt to gain access or install malware. Impersonation: Emails pretending to be from senior executives, vendors, or trusted partners, especially when they ask for urgent actions like wire transfers or confidential information. Look for discrepancies in tone or unusual requests. Unexpected or Unusual Correspondents: Receiving emails from unknown people or contacts you don’t usually interact with should raise suspicion, particularly if they include attachments or links. Sense of Urgency or Threats: Attackers often pressure recipients to act quickly to avoid penalties or “miss out” on opportunities. Take a moment to verify before responding. Generic Greetings: Phishing emails may use generic salutations like “Dear Customer” instead of your name. Poor Grammar or Spelling: Although less common now, some phishing attempts still include errors. Suspicious Attachments or Links: Unexpected files or links, especially if the email encourages you to open them immediately, should be treated cautiously. Hover over links (without clicking) to see the real URL. What To Do If You Spot a Phishing Email If you suspect an email is a phishing attempt: Do Not Click Links or Open Attachments. This prevents accidental malware infection or credential theft. Report It Immediately. Follow your organisation’s established policies for reporting suspicious emails – whether that’s forwarding to your IT or security team, using a “Report Phishing” button in your email client, or submitting through a security portal. Do Not Reply or Engage. Responding can confirm your email is active and may lead to further targeted attacks. Inform Your Team. If appropriate, let colleagues know so they can also be alert to similar threats. Timely reporting helps security teams to block malicious senders, investigate incidents, and protect others within the organisation. Do’s and Don’ts for Handling Phishing Emails Do: Verify the sender’s email address carefully. Check with the supposed sender directly if you receive unexpected or urgent requests. Keep your software and email filters updated. Participate in your organisation’s cybersecurity awareness training. Use multi-factor authentication to reduce risk if credentials are compromised. Don’t: Don’t click links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious emails. Don’t share passwords or sensitive information via email. Don’t ignore suspicious emails even if they seem harmless. Don’t forward suspicious emails to your entire organisation without consulting your security team. Real-Life Example: The CEO Fraud One common phishing scam involves attackers impersonating a CEO or senior executive asking the finance team to urgently transfer funds. In one recent case, an organisation lost over £100,000 before the fraud was detected. The email looked legitimate, used the CEO’s name, and requested an immediate payment citing a confidential business deal. The red flags? The request came outside normal business hours, the finance team wasn’t expecting it, and the email address had a subtle domain spelling error. Because the finance team paused and reported the email, the transfer was stopped just in time. Phishing will remain a top cyber threat, but awareness and vigilance can turn the tide. By recognising suspicious signs and following clear reporting processes, every employee becomes a vital line of defence. Staying Vigilant: Your Best Defence Against Phishing Phishing attacks aren’t going away – in fact, they’re becoming more targeted, more convincing, and more frequent. But with the right mix of awareness, training, and clear reporting processes, organisations can significantly reduce their risk.

Unexpected or Unusual Correspondents: Receiving emails from unknown people or contacts you don’t usually interact with should raise suspicion, particularly if they include attachments or links. Sense of Urgency or Threats: Attackers often pressure recipients to act quickly to avoid penalties or “miss out” on opportunities. Take a moment to verify before responding. Generic Greetings: Phishing emails may use generic salutations like “Dear Customer” instead of your name. Poor Grammar or Spelling: Although less common now, some phishing attempts still include errors. Suspicious Attachments or Links: Unexpected files or links, especially if the email encourages you to open them immediately, should be treated cautiously. Hover over links (without clicking) to see the real URL. What To Do If You Spot a Phishing Email If you suspect an email is a phishing attempt: Do Not Click Links or Open Attachments. This prevents accidental malware infection or credential theft. Report It Immediately. Follow your organisation’s established policies for reporting suspicious emails – whether that’s forwarding to your IT or security team, using a “Report Phishing” button in your email client, or submitting through a security portal. Do Not Reply or Engage. Responding can confirm your email is active and may lead to further targeted attacks. Inform Your Team. If appropriate, let colleagues know so they can also be alert to similar threats. Timely reporting helps security teams to block malicious senders, investigate incidents, and protect others within the organisation. Do’s and Don’ts for Handling Phishing Emails Do: Verify the sender’s email address carefully. Check with the supposed sender directly if you receive unexpected or urgent requests. Keep your software and email filters updated. Participate in your organisation’s cybersecurity awareness training. Use multi-factor authentication to reduce risk if credentials are compromised. Don’t: Don’t click links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious emails. Don’t share passwords or sensitive information via email. Don’t ignore suspicious emails even if they seem harmless. Don’t forward suspicious emails to your entire organisation without consulting your security team. Real-Life Example: The CEO Fraud One common phishing scam involves attackers impersonating a CEO or senior executive asking the finance team to urgently transfer funds. In one recent case, an organisation lost over £100,000 before the fraud was detected. The email looked legitimate, used the CEO’s name, and requested an immediate payment citing a confidential business deal. The red flags? The request came outside normal business hours, the finance team wasn’t expecting it, and the email address had a subtle domain spelling error. Because the finance team paused and reported the email, the transfer was stopped just in time. Phishing will remain a top cyber threat, but awareness and vigilance can turn the tide. By recognising suspicious signs and following clear reporting processes, every employee becomes a vital line of defence. Staying Vigilant: Your Best Defence Against Phishing Phishing attacks aren’t going away – in fact, they’re becoming more targeted, more convincing, and more frequent. But with the right mix of awareness, training, and clear reporting processes, organisations can significantly reduce their risk. At CyberCrowd, we support organisations of all sizes with tailored staff training, phishing simulations, and practical advice to build lasting resilience. Whether you’re reviewing your defences, improving your incident response, or simply want to empower your team to spot and stop phishing threats – we’re here to help.

What once might have seemed like a rare nuisance is now one of the most prevalent and dangerous cyber threats faced today. But what exactly is phishing – and why is it such a growing problem? What Is Phishing? Phishing is a cyberattack technique where attackers impersonate trusted sources to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information, clicking on malicious links, or downloading harmful attachments. It often arrives disguised as seemingly legitimate emails, messages, or even phone calls. What makes phishing especially dangerous today is how sophisticated it has become. Gone are the days of obvious spelling mistakes or clumsy grammar. Modern phishing emails often feature: Well-crafted language Genuine-looking logos and formatting Realistic sender addresses (sometimes mimicking real contacts) Contextually relevant content tailored to the target organisation Because of this, phishing remains one of the most effective methods for attackers to breach organisations, steal data, or deliver ransomware. The Scale of the Threat According to the UK Government’s Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2025 , phishing remains the most commonly identified cyber threat , with 84% of medium businesses and 91% of large businesses reporting phishing attempts in the past 12 months. It’s the leading attack vector reported across sectors, often acting as the entry point for more serious breaches such as ransomware or business email compromise. Despite growing awareness, phishing continues to be both widespread and highly effective. For organisations, falling victim to a phishing attack can lead to compromised credentials, financial loss, damaged reputation, and costly downtime. Spotting Phishing Emails: What to Look Out For Recognising phishing attempts is the first step in defending against them. While attacks grow more sophisticated, there are still some telltale signs you can watch for: Weird Domains: Emails from addresses that look similar but are slightly off – like “@yourbank-secure.com” instead of “@yourbank.com” – are a classic red flag. Always double-check the sender’s domain. Odd Invite or Meeting Requests: Unexpected meeting invitations or calendar requests from unknown senders, or unusual meeting details from known contacts, can be an attempt to gain access or install malware. Impersonation: Emails pretending to be from senior executives, vendors, or trusted partners, especially when they ask for urgent actions like wire transfers or confidential information.
