Reject All Save My Preferences Accept All Powered by Reject All Save My Preferences Accept All Blog Post Navigating the AI governance landscape: Key differences between ISO and NIST for AI Reliance Cyber - 15 September 2025 Estimated reading time: 4 minutes Contents External audit and certification Scope of risk management and governance Regional Influence Implementation Philosophy Similarities Between ISO and NIST Decision-Making Criteria for CISOs and ISOs Conclusion About Reliance Cyber : Introduction In the realm of AI governance and risk management, understanding the distinctions between ISO and NIST frameworks is crucial for organisations aiming to enhance their digital presence and customer engagement. Written by Chris Martin External audit and certification ISO standards, such as ISO 42001, often necessitate external audits for certification. This third-party validation boosts stakeholder confidence by demonstrating compliance. Conversely, the NIST AI RMF does not include a certification process. It is a voluntary framework, focusing on risk management rather than formalised compliance. Scope of risk management and governance ISO integrates ethical principles, organisational accountability, and lifecycle risk assessments into a single framework, addressing both risk management and governance. On the other hand, NIST primarily emphasises risk management, offering detailed guidelines on identifying, mitigating, and monitoring AI risks without delving deeply into broader governance structures. Regional Influence As an international standard, ISO is globally recognised and widely adopted, making it suitable for multinational organisations. In contrast, NIST , developed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, has a stronger influence in the United States and aligns with U.S. regulatory and cultural contexts. Implementation Philosophy ISO provides a structured, prescriptive approach with clear guidelines and requirements for compliance. NIST , however, emphasises flexibility, allowing organisations to adapt the framework to their unique needs. Similarities Between ISO and NIST Despite their differences, both frameworks share core principles that make them complementary: Risk Management : Both prioritise identifying, assessing, and mitigating AI-related risks throughout the system lifecycle. Ethical AI Development : They emphasise fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI systems, ensuring alignment with ethical principles. Practical Guidance : Both provide actionable recommendations and controls, enabling organisations to implement effective risk management strategies. Stakeholder Engagement : ISO and NIST stress the importance of stakeholder involvement, advocating for inclusive and transparent AI governance. Decision-Making Criteria for CISOs and ISOs When choosing between ISO and NIST, consider the following factors: Need for Certification : Opt for ISO if external validation and certification are a priority. Focus on Governance : Choose ISO for comprehensive governance structures; prefer NIST for risk-centric approaches. Geographical Relevance : U.S.-focused organisations may favour NIST, while international firms might align better with ISO. Flexibility vs. Rigor : Select NIST for adaptability or ISO for a prescriptive approach. Organisational Maturity : Mature organisations with established governance structures may integrate NIST for specific risk management needs, while ISO can guide less mature firms to build robust governance systems. Conclusion Both ISO and NIST frameworks offer valuable guidance for AI governance and risk management. ISO provides a structured, certification-driven approach with a focus on governance, while NIST emphasises flexibility and risk management without requiring certification. CISOs and ISOs should assess their organisational needs, operational focus, and stakeholder expectations to determine the most suitable framework. In many cases, combining elements of both standards can yield the best results, leveraging ISO for governance and certification, while using NIST for its adaptable risk management practices. By adopting the right framework—or a blend of both—your organisation can build trustworthy, ethical, and resilient AI systems.

Written by Chris Martin External audit and certification ISO standards, such as ISO 42001, often necessitate external audits for certification. This third-party validation boosts stakeholder confidence by demonstrating compliance. Conversely, the NIST AI RMF does not include a certification process. It is a voluntary framework, focusing on risk management rather than formalised compliance. Scope of risk management and governance ISO integrates ethical principles, organisational accountability, and lifecycle risk assessments into a single framework, addressing both risk management and governance. On the other hand, NIST primarily emphasises risk management, offering detailed guidelines on identifying, mitigating, and monitoring AI risks without delving deeply into broader governance structures. Regional Influence As an international standard, ISO is globally recognised and widely adopted, making it suitable for multinational organisations. In contrast, NIST , developed by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, has a stronger influence in the United States and aligns with U.S. regulatory and cultural contexts. Implementation Philosophy ISO provides a structured, prescriptive approach with clear guidelines and requirements for compliance. NIST , however, emphasises flexibility, allowing organisations to adapt the framework to their unique needs. Similarities Between ISO and NIST Despite their differences, both frameworks share core principles that make them complementary: Risk Management : Both prioritise identifying, assessing, and mitigating AI-related risks throughout the system lifecycle. Ethical AI Development : They emphasise fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI systems, ensuring alignment with ethical principles. Practical Guidance : Both provide actionable recommendations and controls, enabling organisations to implement effective risk management strategies. Stakeholder Engagement : ISO and NIST stress the importance of stakeholder involvement, advocating for inclusive and transparent AI governance. Decision-Making Criteria for CISOs and ISOs When choosing between ISO and NIST, consider the following factors: Need for Certification : Opt for ISO if external validation and certification are a priority. Focus on Governance : Choose ISO for comprehensive governance structures; prefer NIST for risk-centric approaches. Geographical Relevance : U.S.-focused organisations may favour NIST, while international firms might align better with ISO. Flexibility vs. Rigor : Select NIST for adaptability or ISO for a prescriptive approach. Organisational Maturity : Mature organisations with established governance structures may integrate NIST for specific risk management needs, while ISO can guide less mature firms to build robust governance systems. Conclusion Both ISO and NIST frameworks offer valuable guidance for AI governance and risk management. ISO provides a structured, certification-driven approach with a focus on governance, while NIST emphasises flexibility and risk management without requiring certification. CISOs and ISOs should assess their organisational needs, operational focus, and stakeholder expectations to determine the most suitable framework. In many cases, combining elements of both standards can yield the best results, leveraging ISO for governance and certification, while using NIST for its adaptable risk management practices. By adopting the right framework—or a blend of both—your organisation can build trustworthy, ethical, and resilient AI systems.
