Cookie Policy Cookie Policy Like the vast majority of websites, we use ‘cookies’ in order to provide you with the best possible experience when you visit the CyberCrowd websites. What personal information is collected? Certain cookies contain personal information – for example, if you click to ‘remember me’ when logging in, a cookie will store your username. Most cookies won’t collect information that identifies you, and will instead collect more general information such as how users arrive at and use our websites, or a user’s general location. What sort of cookies do our websites use? Generally, our cookies perform up to four different functions: Essential cookies Some cookies are essential for the operation of our website. For example, some cookies allow us to identify subscribers and ensure they can access the subscription only pages. If a subscriber opts to disable these cookies, the user will not be able to access all of the content that a subscription entitles them to. Performance cookies We utilise other cookies to analyse how our visitors use our wesbites and to monitor website performance. This allows us to provide a high quality experience by customising our offering and quickly identifying and fixing any issues that arise. For example, we might use performance cookies to keep track of which pages are most popular, which method of linking between pages is most effective, and to determine why some pages are receiving error messages. We might also use these cookies to highlight articles or website services that we think will be of interest to you based on your usage of the website. Functionality cookies We use functionality cookies to allow us to remember your preferences. For example, cookies save you the trouble of typing your username every time you access one of the websites, and recall your customisation preferences, such as which regional edition of the website you want to see when you log in. Behaviourally targeted advertising cookies We (and our advertisers) use cookies to serve you with advertisements that we believe are relevant to you and your interests. Google analytics Our website uses google analytics, for more information about this, please see Google’s help pages and privacy policy: Google’s privacy policy Google analytics help pages Google have developed the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on for the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, dc.js).
