SecurityBrief UK - Technology news for CISOs & cybersecurity decision-makers United Kingdom Guides # cloud security # cybersecurity # endpoint protection # firewalls # ransomware Search # Storage # Data Protection # DR AvePoint boosts AI agent governance & cloud backups Fri, 6th Feb 2026 (Today) By Sofiah Nichole Salivio, News Editor AvePoint has expanded its Confidence Platform with new features to govern agentic AI and protect data across a wider set of cloud services. The update introduces a new way for customers to define risk for AI agents, expands backup coverage across more software-as-a-service applications, and adds support for additional infrastructure and platform services. Agent Governance Agentic AI tools increasingly sit on top of corporate data and carry out tasks with a degree of autonomy. That raises questions about how organisations assess behaviour, enforce controls, and respond when an agent acts outside policy. Confidence Platform now includes a risk definition framework for AI agents. Customers can set their own risk posture and monitor agents against those rules. The platform also provides more detail on an agent's security posture and lets users address security issues from the same console. The new functions build on capabilities introduced through AvePoint AgentPulse Command Centre and are positioned as a step towards tighter oversight of how agents interact with data and systems. MIT researchers have stated that 95% of agentic AI projects will fail to meet their goals, largely due to data quality concerns. Data protection vendors and governance specialists have utilised that message to argue that AI roll-outs depend on consistent controls over information access, retention, and recovery. In AvePoint's approach, monitoring ties back to the defined risk model. When the platform identifies a security issue, customers can remediate agent-related risks within the Confidence Platform. John Hodges, Chief Product Officer, described the release as a continuation of work announced last year. "AvePoint continues to build new, innovative products to drive world-class data security and governance for AI and agentic AI, as exemplified by our AgentPulse launch last November," Hodges said. "These latest updates build on that momentum, ensuring our customers have access to the tools they need to use agentic AI tools safely and efficiently. We understand that organizations are under pressure to deliver successful agentic AI initiatives, and we continue to give them the confidence and control they need to ensure that their agentic AI investments are meaningful and secure." Wider Coverage Alongside agent governance, AvePoint has expanded the services supported for multi-SaaS backup. Newly covered sources include Okta, Confluence, Jira, DocuSign, Monday.com, GitHub, and Smartsheet. These products generate identity data, collaboration content, development artefacts, and workflow records that many organisations treat as operationally critical. AvePoint has also added new infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service sources, including Google Cloud Storage, Microsoft SQL Server, and Azure VMware. Data from these sources now appears in its Data Resiliency Command Centre, which provides a consolidated view of coverage and risk. The additions reflect a broader shift in data protection strategy among cloud-first companies. Workloads often span Microsoft, Google, Salesforce, and specialist SaaS tools, and backup and recovery policies can fragment as teams adopt services independently. Vendors have responded with broader connectors, centralised policy management, and reporting that maps data sources to risk and compliance requirements. John Peluso, Chief Technology Officer, said the expansion is aimed at customers operating across several cloud environments. "We know that today's data protection and governance challenges aren't limited to a single platform or cloud environment," Peluso said. "That's why AvePoint is taking steps to offer even more protection and governance support to customers across Microsoft, Google, Salesforce, and other cloud environments. Our mission will always be protecting you and your data, wherever it lives, whenever you operate," he said. Backup Strategy The announcement builds on AvePoint's work around data protection and what it calls a "unified and extensible foundation" for safeguarding information. AvePoint noted its position as a launch partner for Microsoft 365 Backup Storage and highlighted its Cloud Backup Express product for backup and recovery. Backup performance remains a key point of competition in cloud data protection, particularly for collaboration suites where large tenants can face lengthy recovery windows. At the same time, organisations are weighing cost and complexity as they decide which systems require rapid recovery and which can tolerate longer restoration times. AvePoint said customers can "right-size" protection and choose faster coverage for specific sources. The company will discuss the product updates during an upcoming webinar, with further platform enhancements expected as agentic AI adoption expands across business functions.
