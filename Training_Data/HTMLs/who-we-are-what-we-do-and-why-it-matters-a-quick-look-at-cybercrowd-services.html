News CyberCrowd is a cyber security specialist, protecting organisations of all sizes from evolving digital threats. With a forward-thinking approach, we help businesses navigate complex risks and build real-world resilience against cybercrime. Whether we’re simulating attacks, securing cloud environments, or assessing third-party risk, our mission is simple: to empower organisations to operate safely and securely in a connected world . We deliver a full range of services – from 24/7 monitoring via our UK-based Security Operations Centre (SOC) to CREST-accredited penetration testing , incident response , Cyber Essentials , and tailored training programmes . But what really sets us apart is how we work: with clarity, collaboration, and a deep understanding of the challenges today’s organisations face. We don’t just help you tick the compliance boxes – we help you build real security that lasts . Here’s a quick guide to our services and how they help organisations stay resilient, compliant, and prepared for whatever’s next. Technical Testing That Uncovers Risk Before Attackers Do Penetration Testing is a vital part of our service portfolio, designed to uncover real-world vulnerabilities before threat actors find them. Whether it’s your network , web applications , Wi-Fi infrastructure , or hardware and devices , our experienced team can test, report, and recommend in a clear, actionable way. We also offer advanced testing techniques including Red Teaming and AI/LLM testing – ideal for organisations embracing generative AI and automation, but keen to stay ahead of associated threats. And with our Client Portal , you’ll get full visibility of every test, finding, and fix – in one secure, accessible platform. Secure Cloud, From the Inside Out Misconfigured cloud environments are a common weak point. Our Cloud Configuration Reviews and cloud penetration testing services help identify gaps in your AWS, Azure, or GCP setups, before they become security incidents. We highlight risk, provide practical remediation advice, and help your team implement best practices for long-term resilience. Prioritise Action with Vulnerability Assessments Too many vulnerabilities and too little time? Our vulnerability assessments cut through the noise, helping you focus on what matters. We assess, prioritise, and contextualise risk so you can protect what’s most important – without being overwhelmed by false alarms. Certification Readiness and Cyber Assurance We support businesses looking to strengthen their security posture through recognised frameworks. Whether it’s achieving Cyber Essentials , preparing for ISO 27001 , tackling PCI DSS , or improving overall cyber hygiene, we guide you through each step – removing the complexity and helping you pass with confidence. Prepare and Practice with Incident Exercises Knowing how you’ll respond to a cyber incident is as important as trying to prevent one. Our Cyber Incident Tabletop Exercises put your team through real-life scenarios in a safe environment – highlighting gaps, improving response, and ensuring you’re ready for the unexpected. Data Protection That Makes Sense Our data protection services help you align with privacy regulations like UK GDPR , manage risk, and build trust with your customers. From audits and policy support to hands-on advice and virtual Data Protection Officer (vDPO) services, we simplify compliance without slowing you down. Strategic Support, Whenever You Need It From part-time help to full leadership, our virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) offering gives you direct access to strategic cyber expertise, without the overhead of hiring in-house. We’ll work alongside your team to shape policy, lead change, and ensure cyber security is aligned to your business goals. Respond Fast, Recover Strong When the worst happens, our Incident Response team is here to help you contain the issue, investigate, and recover. From ransomware outbreaks to insider threats, we provide hands-on expertise when you need it most – with guidance on improving defences post-incident, too. UK-Based 24/7 Monitoring & Managed SOC Peace of mind, day or night. Our UK-based Managed Security Operations Centre (SOC) provides round-the-clock monitoring, threat detection, and alert response – giving you the reassurance that your environment is being actively watched, even when you’re not. Building a Culture of Cyber Awareness We believe real security starts with people. Our training and awareness programmes are tailored to your organisation – covering everything from phishing simulations to secure-by-design thinking and leadership coaching. Because a secure business is one where every individual understands their role in protecting it. Why Expert-Led Security Matters More Than Ever With 43% of UK organisations reporting a cyber breach in the past year, the threat landscape has never been more complex – or relentless. High-profile incidents continue to demonstrate the real-world impact: Retail giants like Marks & Spencer and Co‑op suffered major cyber assaults forcing website shutdowns, disrupted deliveries, and losses in the tens of millions, with knock-on effects felt by small suppliers. Ransomware attacks on public sector organisations – including NHS and school networks – have led to patient care delays, exam disruption, and even temporary school closures. These incidents are just a few examples that underscore a critical gap: too many teams lack the specialist knowledge needed to assess evolving threats, configure defences, or respond rapidly when it matters most. That’s where expert-led security comes in. With accredited technical testing, strategic guidance, and round-the-clock monitoring , our team helps ensure your organisation isn’t just reacting to attacks, but actively preventing and learning from them. When cyber risk becomes business risk, professional expertise isn’t optional – it’s essential. Expertise That Goes Beyond the Checklist At the heart of everything we do is a commitment to strategic innovation, partnership, and expertise. We’re not just a service provider – we’re an extension of your team. Whether we’re helping you shape your long-term security strategy or supporting you through a technical sprint, our goal is always the same: to make cyber security clear, practical, and achievable . We hold multiple accreditations, including ISO 27001, and are CREST and Cyber Essentials Plus certified – giving you confidence that our methods and team meet the highest standards in the industry. In addition, we are proud to be an NCSC Assured Service Provider for Cyber Advisor (Cyber Essentials) , Cyber Incident Exercising and Cyber Incident Response (Level 2), reinforcing our capability to deliver trusted, government-recognised cyber security support. Ready to Talk? If you’re facing new challenges or want a fresh approach to securing your organisation, we’re here to help. Get in touch with our team to explore how CyberCrowd can support your goals – with expertise you can trust and services that work for you.

With a forward-thinking approach, we help businesses navigate complex risks and build real-world resilience against cybercrime. Whether we’re simulating attacks, securing cloud environments, or assessing third-party risk, our mission is simple: to empower organisations to operate safely and securely in a connected world . We deliver a full range of services – from 24/7 monitoring via our UK-based Security Operations Centre (SOC) to CREST-accredited penetration testing , incident response , Cyber Essentials , and tailored training programmes . But what really sets us apart is how we work: with clarity, collaboration, and a deep understanding of the challenges today’s organisations face. We don’t just help you tick the compliance boxes – we help you build real security that lasts . Here’s a quick guide to our services and how they help organisations stay resilient, compliant, and prepared for whatever’s next. Technical Testing That Uncovers Risk Before Attackers Do Penetration Testing is a vital part of our service portfolio, designed to uncover real-world vulnerabilities before threat actors find them. Whether it’s your network , web applications , Wi-Fi infrastructure , or hardware and devices , our experienced team can test, report, and recommend in a clear, actionable way. We also offer advanced testing techniques including Red Teaming and AI/LLM testing – ideal for organisations embracing generative AI and automation, but keen to stay ahead of associated threats. And with our Client Portal , you’ll get full visibility of every test, finding, and fix – in one secure, accessible platform. Secure Cloud, From the Inside Out Misconfigured cloud environments are a common weak point. Our Cloud Configuration Reviews and cloud penetration testing services help identify gaps in your AWS, Azure, or GCP setups, before they become security incidents. We highlight risk, provide practical remediation advice, and help your team implement best practices for long-term resilience. Prioritise Action with Vulnerability Assessments Too many vulnerabilities and too little time? Our vulnerability assessments cut through the noise, helping you focus on what matters. We assess, prioritise, and contextualise risk so you can protect what’s most important – without being overwhelmed by false alarms. Certification Readiness and Cyber Assurance We support businesses looking to strengthen their security posture through recognised frameworks. Whether it’s achieving Cyber Essentials , preparing for ISO 27001 , tackling PCI DSS , or improving overall cyber hygiene, we guide you through each step – removing the complexity and helping you pass with confidence. Prepare and Practice with Incident Exercises Knowing how you’ll respond to a cyber incident is as important as trying to prevent one. Our Cyber Incident Tabletop Exercises put your team through real-life scenarios in a safe environment – highlighting gaps, improving response, and ensuring you’re ready for the unexpected. Data Protection That Makes Sense Our data protection services help you align with privacy regulations like UK GDPR , manage risk, and build trust with your customers. From audits and policy support to hands-on advice and virtual Data Protection Officer (vDPO) services, we simplify compliance without slowing you down. Strategic Support, Whenever You Need It From part-time help to full leadership, our virtual Chief Information Security Officer (vCISO) offering gives you direct access to strategic cyber expertise, without the overhead of hiring in-house. We’ll work alongside your team to shape policy, lead change, and ensure cyber security is aligned to your business goals. Respond Fast, Recover Strong When the worst happens, our Incident Response team is here to help you contain the issue, investigate, and recover. From ransomware outbreaks to insider threats, we provide hands-on expertise when you need it most – with guidance on improving defences post-incident, too. UK-Based 24/7 Monitoring & Managed SOC Peace of mind, day or night. Our UK-based Managed Security Operations Centre (SOC) provides round-the-clock monitoring, threat detection, and alert response – giving you the reassurance that your environment is being actively watched, even when you’re not. Building a Culture of Cyber Awareness We believe real security starts with people. Our training and awareness programmes are tailored to your organisation – covering everything from phishing simulations to secure-by-design thinking and leadership coaching. Because a secure business is one where every individual understands their role in protecting it. Why Expert-Led Security Matters More Than Ever With 43% of UK organisations reporting a cyber breach in the past year, the threat landscape has never been more complex – or relentless. High-profile incidents continue to demonstrate the real-world impact: Retail giants like Marks & Spencer and Co‑op suffered major cyber assaults forcing website shutdowns, disrupted deliveries, and losses in the tens of millions, with knock-on effects felt by small suppliers. Ransomware attacks on public sector organisations – including NHS and school networks – have led to patient care delays, exam disruption, and even temporary school closures. These incidents are just a few examples that underscore a critical gap: too many teams lack the specialist knowledge needed to assess evolving threats, configure defences, or respond rapidly when it matters most. That’s where expert-led security comes in. With accredited technical testing, strategic guidance, and round-the-clock monitoring , our team helps ensure your organisation isn’t just reacting to attacks, but actively preventing and learning from them. When cyber risk becomes business risk, professional expertise isn’t optional – it’s essential. Expertise That Goes Beyond the Checklist At the heart of everything we do is a commitment to strategic innovation, partnership, and expertise. We’re not just a service provider – we’re an extension of your team. Whether we’re helping you shape your long-term security strategy or supporting you through a technical sprint, our goal is always the same: to make cyber security clear, practical, and achievable . We hold multiple accreditations, including ISO 27001, and are CREST and Cyber Essentials Plus certified – giving you confidence that our methods and team meet the highest standards in the industry. In addition, we are proud to be an NCSC Assured Service Provider for Cyber Advisor (Cyber Essentials) , Cyber Incident Exercising and Cyber Incident Response (Level 2), reinforcing our capability to deliver trusted, government-recognised cyber security support.
