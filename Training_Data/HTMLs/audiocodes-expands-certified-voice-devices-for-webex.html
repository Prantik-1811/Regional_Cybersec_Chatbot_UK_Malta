TelcoNews US - Telecommunications news for ICT decision-makers United States Guides # 5g & beyond # internet of things # software-defined networking # space technologies # unified communications Search # UC # Digital Transformation # Partner Programmes AudioCodes expands certified voice devices for Webex Fri, 6th Feb 2026 (Today) By Kaleah Salmon, News Editor AudioCodes has expanded its certified voice product line for Webex Calling, adding three desk phone models and a range of analogue gateways that integrate with Cisco's cloud calling service. The move extends AudioCodes' role in Webex Calling deployments beyond network connectivity and session border controllers. The expanded certification gives partners and customers more choice in endpoint devices and in how they connect legacy equipment during cloud migration. Webex Calling is Cisco's cloud-based unified communications platform, delivering calling features through the cloud and managed through the Webex Control Hub. AudioCodes has certified three models in its 400HD IP phone series for use with Webex Calling: the C450HD, 445HD and 425HD. It has also certified MediaPack analogue gateways to connect older analogue devices to the cloud calling service. Phone models The newly certified phones target a range of workplace users, from executives to office workers and those in shared spaces. AudioCodes positions the models as offering a familiar calling experience for organisations standardising on Webex Calling. The C450HD is the top-end model, with a 5-inch colour touchscreen, integrated Wi‑Fi and optional expansion hardware. AudioCodes positions the 445HD as a high-end business phone. It has a 4.3-inch colour screen and an integrated LCD sidecar for speed-dial contacts and presence monitoring, along with programmable multi-function keys and dedicated speed-dial keys. The 425HD is a mid-range option aimed at office workers and common areas. It includes a 3.5-inch colour display and programmable keys. The phones support centralised management through AudioCodes Device Manager and the Webex Control Hub, covering provisioning, monitoring and software updates. Analogueue migration The MediaPack analogue gateways address a common challenge in cloud calling projects: continued reliance on analogue devices in offices and industrial sites. Many organisations still use endpoints such as fax machines, door entry systems, lift phones and alarm panels, which often require a gateway to connect to IP-based calling services. AudioCodes has certified its MediaPack MP-1xx, MP-2xx and MP-5xx gateway families for Webex Calling. The range covers different port densities, determining how many analogue lines each appliance can connect. AudioCodes describes the line-up as scalable for organisations migrating sites or departments to cloud calling in phases. The certification also gives partners another option for Webex Calling migration and managed services. Analogue gateways can be deployed alongside IP phones and cloud connectivity services in a single project, reducing the need for additional suppliers. Existing footprint Before these additions, AudioCodes already had certified offerings for Webex Calling, including PSTN connectivity via Cloud Connect and session border controllers certified as third-party gateways for premises PSTN connectivity (previously known as Local Gateway). The company also lists certifications tied to Webex Calling delivery models, including Certified Calling Partner for Cloud Connect voice connectivity in the USA, Canada, and countries across EMEA and Latin America. It also cites the status of Cloud Connect Enablement Provider and Certified Mobile Calling Provider. The expanded certification places AudioCodes among vendors that provide endpoints and gateways compatible with Webex Calling. For Cisco customers, certified devices are typically used to reduce integration work and simplify the support model. AudioCodes also provides professional services and 24/7 global support for Webex Calling deployments, working through partners and directly with end customers. AudioCodes sells IP phones and voice connectivity products across multiple unified communications ecosystems, and says its IP phone range is certified for other unified communications platforms-an option for organisations running mixed environments or planning changes over time. AudioCodes frames the Webex Calling certifications as part of a wider effort to broaden its voice device portfolio across cloud communications platforms. "The recent certification of our devices for Webex Calling is a testament to AudioCodes' commitment to delivering best-in-class voice solutions for unified communications," said Nati Davidi, Devices Business Line Manager, AudioCodes. "Our devices are designed to accelerate the adoption of Webex Calling by offering users an intuitive, reliable and feature-rich experience. They also assist partners and service providers to simplify the delivery of end-to-end, certified voice enablement solutions for Webex Calling environments."
