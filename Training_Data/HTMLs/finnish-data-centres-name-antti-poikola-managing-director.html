SecurityBrief UK - Technology news for CISOs & cybersecurity decision-makers United Kingdom Guides # cloud security # cybersecurity # endpoint protection # firewalls # ransomware Search # DataCentre infrastructure # Hyperscale # DC Finnish Data Centres name Antti Poikola Managing Director Thu, 29th Jan 2026 By Sofiah Nichole Salivio, News Editor Finnish Data Centre Association has appointed Antti "Jogi" Poikola as its new Managing Director as the organisation looks to raise the profile of Finland's data centre sector amid growing investment and activity. Poikola will take up the role in early February. He joins Finnish Data Centre Association from Technology Industries of Finland, where he worked as Lead Expert in the data economy. The association said Poikola has experience across information and technology policy, public affairs communications, and building networks in Finland and across Europe. It positions the appointment as part of a wider effort to strengthen recognition of the data centre industry as it expands in the country. Industry focus Finnish Data Centre Association described Finland as having an opportunity to become a leading country in sustainable digital infrastructure in Europe. It said the data centre industry continues to grow rapidly in Finland. Poikola will lead the association's day-to-day operations. The remit also includes stakeholder collaboration and the development of the association's activities. The association said he will work closely with its board and member companies. The data centre sector has drawn attention in the Nordics in recent years due to access to low-carbon electricity, established district heating networks, and a cool climate. Finland has promoted its position in digital infrastructure alongside its broader industrial and technology base. Membership base Founded in 2014, Finnish Data Centre Association represents companies active in the country's data centre industry. Its membership includes data centre operators and a range of service providers involved in construction, maintenance and operations. The association also counts consulting firms, equipment manufacturers, educational institutions, regional development companies, and other stakeholders among its members. It said its membership includes more than 200 companies. The breadth of the membership reflects the supply chain around data centre projects, which can span civil engineering, electrical infrastructure, cooling systems, security, software, and connectivity services. The mix also highlights the role of regional development bodies and education providers in building skills and local ecosystems linked to large infrastructure projects. Policy backdrop Data centres have become a more prominent topic in national policy discussions across Europe. Governments and industry groups have debated energy use, grid connections, planning regimes, sustainability reporting, and heat reuse. Finland has positioned itself as a location for data centres in part due to its power generation mix and the availability of sites outside major metropolitan areas. Large electricity users also face increasing scrutiny over how they source energy and how infrastructure projects affect local communities. Industry associations such as Finnish Data Centre Association often play a role in presenting sector views to policymakers and regulators, and in convening suppliers and operators around shared technical and operational practices. They also act as a channel for wider conversations about investment conditions and infrastructure readiness, including power supply and fibre connectivity. Poikola's background in the data economy at Technology Industries of Finland signals that the association expects continued discussion about the role of digital infrastructure in the wider economy. It also comes as European institutions and member states look more closely at data sovereignty, resilience, and the physical infrastructure that underpins cloud services and digital public services. Leadership change Finnish Data Centre Association said Poikola is motivated to work on Finland's attractiveness as a location for data centres and on the benefits associated with data centre activity. "Internationally, Finland is known as a country of sustainable data centers. We must fully leverage this position and build a strong Finnish ecosystem around data center investments," said Antti "Jogi" Poikola, Managing Director, Finnish Data Centre Association. The association has not provided further detail on specific initiatives that Poikola will lead once in post, or how it plans to measure progress in visibility and recognition of the sector. Poikola will work with the association's board and member companies as the organisation develops its activities and engages with stakeholders in Finland and beyond.
