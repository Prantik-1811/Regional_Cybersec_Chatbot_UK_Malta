News Proud to be named for a second year running! We’re pleased to announce that CyberCrowd has been recognised in The Sunday Times Best Places to Work 2025 , in the Small Organisation category – marking our second consecutive year receiving this prestigious honour. This recognition highlights the strength of our culture, our commitment to employee wellbeing, and the value we place on creating a supportive, high-performing workplace. At CyberCrowd, we believe our people are at the heart of our success – and we’re proud that their feedback has once again placed us amongst the best employers in the UK. Powered by WorkL , the Sunday Times Best Places to Work awards are based on a robust survey designed by behavioural scientists, data analysts, and workplace experts. The assessment explores six key areas: Reward & Recognition, Instilling Pride, Information Sharing, Empowerment, Wellbeing and Job Satisfaction – areas we continuously strive to strengthen across the business. As The Sunday Times notes: “These are companies where staff have a spring in their step on Monday mornings and a willingness to go the extra mile. Why have a job just anywhere when you could be carving out a career at a Sunday Times Best Place to Work?” Shaping a Workplace That Works for Everyone This achievement reflects our ongoing focus on creating an environment where people feel valued, heard and empowered to grow. Whether it’s through clear communication, strong leadership, flexible working, or professional development opportunities, we aim to build a workplace where individuals can thrive, and teams can excel. Sarah Rolls, HR Director at CyberCrowd, commented: “To be recognised for a second-year running is a real honour and a proud moment for all of us at CyberCrowd. It reflects the culture our team has helped shape – one built on trust, collaboration and purpose, where people can grow, thrive and truly feel they belong. This recognition is a direct reflection of our team, and we’re incredibly grateful for their continued commitment and feedback.” To our amazing CyberCrowd Team — thank you. This one’s for you. As we grow, our commitment remains the same: to invest in our people, to listen and adapt, and to ensure CyberCrowd continues to be a workplace where people are proud to belong.
