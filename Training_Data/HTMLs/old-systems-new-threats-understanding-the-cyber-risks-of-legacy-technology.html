News When we think about cyber security, the conversation often jumps straight to the newest threats: AI-powered phishing campaigns, zero-day exploits, or sophisticated ransomware gangs. Yet, the truth is that some of the greatest risks facing organisations today come from much older sources – the legacy technology still running quietly in the background. This week, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) issued a fresh warning that attackers are actively targeting outdated Cisco devices. Many of these routers and switches are end-of-life, which means they can’t receive the critical updates needed to close known vulnerabilities. For cybercriminals, they’re low-hanging fruit – and they know organisations often overlook them. It’s a reminder that in cyber security, the past is never really behind us. Why legacy technology is such a problem 1. No patches, no protection When a product reaches “end of life” or “end of support,” the manufacturer stops issuing updates. That means any new vulnerability discovered is effectively permanent. For attackers, it’s like finding a door that will never be locked. 2. Hidden in plain sight Legacy systems often linger unnoticed. A forgotten server in the comms room, an old router tucked away in a branch office, or software quietly powering a back-end process. Because they’re not “front of house,” they rarely get the attention they deserve during cyber audits. 3. Mission critical and hard to move on from Ironically, many legacy systems are business-critical. They run core processes, connect remote sites, or underpin legacy applications that modern replacements don’t fully support. This makes them hard to retire, and creates resistance to change. 4. The weakest link principle Attackers don’t need to break through your strongest defences. They just need one weak point. A single outdated device can undermine an otherwise mature cyber security posture. Real-world examples of legacy risk The risks aren’t theoretical. Legacy technology has been at the heart of several high-profile incidents: NHS WannaCry attack (2017): Thousands of NHS systems were taken offline when WannaCry ransomware exploited outdated Windows XP machines that had missed critical patches. The disruption caused cancelled appointments, delayed care, and cost an estimated £92 million. Equifax breach (2017): The credit rating giant suffered a breach exposing personal details of 147 million people. The root cause? A missed patch on a legacy Apache Struts server. Airline disruptions: Outages at airports have repeatedly been linked to legacy software systems – often decades old – that struggle under modern demands and are vulnerable to attacks. Each case highlights the same truth: ignoring outdated systems isn’t just a technical risk – it’s a business continuity and reputational one. Why organisations hold on to outdated systems If legacy technology is so risky, why do organisations cling to it? A few common reasons: Cost pressures: Upgrading infrastructure is expensive, and budgets are often diverted to more visible initiatives. Complex dependencies: Legacy systems are tied to older applications or processes that can’t easily be replaced. Short-term thinking: “If it still works, leave it alone” — until it breaks or is exploited. Underestimation of risk: Many organisations see old kit as “boring IT” rather than a live cyber vulnerability. The problem is that attackers don’t share that complacency. They actively scan for out-of-date devices to exploit. What organisations can do about it Dealing with legacy risk isn’t easy – but it is possible. A structured approach can make the difference between resilience and exposure: 1. Audit and inventory You can’t protect what you don’t know you have. A comprehensive inventory of hardware and software, including support status and patch history, is the starting point. 2. Build lifecycle planning into budgets Cyber security isn’t just about tools and training – it’s about long-term planning. Lifecycle management should be built into IT and security budgets so equipment is refreshed before it becomes a liability. 3. Apply compensating controls Where legacy systems must remain, segment them on the network, restrict access, and apply extra monitoring. Treat them as “untrusted” zones to reduce the blast radius if they are compromised. 4. Seek specialist support Sometimes, managed services or extended vendor support can provide temporary patches, virtual patching, or monitoring to reduce risk while transition plans are developed. 5. Elevate the conversation Legacy technology risk is not just an IT issue — it’s a board-level discussion. Linking it directly to business continuity, compliance obligations, and reputational impact helps ensure leadership gives it the attention (and funding) it deserves. Looking ahead The pace of technology means that today’s cutting-edge solutions will inevitably become tomorrow’s legacy. The challenge for organisations is to break the cycle of “sweating assets” until they become unsafe. Proactive governance can turn technology refreshes from a reactive fire drill into a predictable business process. Cultural change – recognising that cyber resilience isn’t just about defending against external threats, but also managing internal weaknesses – will be key. Partnerships with trusted cyber security providers can bring expertise, monitoring, and lifecycle strategy that many internal teams simply don’t have capacity for. Final thought Cyber criminals don’t care how old your infrastructure is. In fact, the older the better. Outdated routers, unsupported servers, and forgotten applications provide the perfect entry point. In today’s environment, resilience means taking legacy technology as seriously as any new threat. At CyberCrowd, we work with organisations to uncover hidden vulnerabilities, manage lifecycle risks, and strengthen resilience across every layer of their infrastructure. Because in cyber security, the past isn’t just history – it’s often the biggest risk to the future.

They actively scan for out-of-date devices to exploit. What organisations can do about it Dealing with legacy risk isn’t easy – but it is possible. A structured approach can make the difference between resilience and exposure: 1. Audit and inventory You can’t protect what you don’t know you have. A comprehensive inventory of hardware and software, including support status and patch history, is the starting point. 2. Build lifecycle planning into budgets Cyber security isn’t just about tools and training – it’s about long-term planning. Lifecycle management should be built into IT and security budgets so equipment is refreshed before it becomes a liability. 3. Apply compensating controls Where legacy systems must remain, segment them on the network, restrict access, and apply extra monitoring. Treat them as “untrusted” zones to reduce the blast radius if they are compromised. 4. Seek specialist support Sometimes, managed services or extended vendor support can provide temporary patches, virtual patching, or monitoring to reduce risk while transition plans are developed. 5. Elevate the conversation Legacy technology risk is not just an IT issue — it’s a board-level discussion. Linking it directly to business continuity, compliance obligations, and reputational impact helps ensure leadership gives it the attention (and funding) it deserves. Looking ahead The pace of technology means that today’s cutting-edge solutions will inevitably become tomorrow’s legacy. The challenge for organisations is to break the cycle of “sweating assets” until they become unsafe. Proactive governance can turn technology refreshes from a reactive fire drill into a predictable business process. Cultural change – recognising that cyber resilience isn’t just about defending against external threats, but also managing internal weaknesses – will be key. Partnerships with trusted cyber security providers can bring expertise, monitoring, and lifecycle strategy that many internal teams simply don’t have capacity for. Final thought Cyber criminals don’t care how old your infrastructure is. In fact, the older the better. Outdated routers, unsupported servers, and forgotten applications provide the perfect entry point. In today’s environment, resilience means taking legacy technology as seriously as any new threat. At CyberCrowd, we work with organisations to uncover hidden vulnerabilities, manage lifecycle risks, and strengthen resilience across every layer of their infrastructure. Because in cyber security, the past isn’t just history – it’s often the biggest risk to the future.

Yet, the truth is that some of the greatest risks facing organisations today come from much older sources – the legacy technology still running quietly in the background. This week, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) issued a fresh warning that attackers are actively targeting outdated Cisco devices. Many of these routers and switches are end-of-life, which means they can’t receive the critical updates needed to close known vulnerabilities. For cybercriminals, they’re low-hanging fruit – and they know organisations often overlook them. It’s a reminder that in cyber security, the past is never really behind us. Why legacy technology is such a problem 1. No patches, no protection When a product reaches “end of life” or “end of support,” the manufacturer stops issuing updates. That means any new vulnerability discovered is effectively permanent. For attackers, it’s like finding a door that will never be locked. 2. Hidden in plain sight Legacy systems often linger unnoticed. A forgotten server in the comms room, an old router tucked away in a branch office, or software quietly powering a back-end process. Because they’re not “front of house,” they rarely get the attention they deserve during cyber audits. 3. Mission critical and hard to move on from Ironically, many legacy systems are business-critical. They run core processes, connect remote sites, or underpin legacy applications that modern replacements don’t fully support. This makes them hard to retire, and creates resistance to change. 4. The weakest link principle Attackers don’t need to break through your strongest defences. They just need one weak point. A single outdated device can undermine an otherwise mature cyber security posture. Real-world examples of legacy risk The risks aren’t theoretical. Legacy technology has been at the heart of several high-profile incidents: NHS WannaCry attack (2017): Thousands of NHS systems were taken offline when WannaCry ransomware exploited outdated Windows XP machines that had missed critical patches. The disruption caused cancelled appointments, delayed care, and cost an estimated £92 million. Equifax breach (2017): The credit rating giant suffered a breach exposing personal details of 147 million people. The root cause? A missed patch on a legacy Apache Struts server. Airline disruptions: Outages at airports have repeatedly been linked to legacy software systems – often decades old – that struggle under modern demands and are vulnerable to attacks. Each case highlights the same truth: ignoring outdated systems isn’t just a technical risk – it’s a business continuity and reputational one. Why organisations hold on to outdated systems If legacy technology is so risky, why do organisations cling to it? A few common reasons: Cost pressures: Upgrading infrastructure is expensive, and budgets are often diverted to more visible initiatives. Complex dependencies: Legacy systems are tied to older applications or processes that can’t easily be replaced. Short-term thinking: “If it still works, leave it alone” — until it breaks or is exploited.
