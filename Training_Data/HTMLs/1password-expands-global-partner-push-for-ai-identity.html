SecurityBrief UK - Technology news for CISOs & cybersecurity decision-makers United Kingdom Guides # cloud security # cybersecurity # endpoint protection # firewalls # ransomware Search # SaaS # Digital Transformation # PAM 1Password expands global partner push for AI identity Fri, 6th Feb 2026 (Today) By Mark Tarre, News Chief 1Password has expanded its global partner programme as it looks to drive more channel-led growth amid rising demand for identity security in SaaS-heavy and AI-driven workplaces. The updated programme establishes a single global model, with incentives and discounts for partners. It also adds training and support designed to fit partner workflows. 1Password is positioning the programme around services and recurring revenue as organisations seek identity controls beyond conventional identity and access management approaches. A group of resellers and security specialists have joined the programme, including Insight, GuidePoint Security, QBS Technology Group, SHI International, TD SYNNEX and TRS Consulting. 1Password also highlighted relationships with Optiv and Westcon-Comstor, citing comments from executives at those firms. Channel push The expansion comes as identity takes on greater importance for security teams managing access to cloud applications and automation tools. Many organisations now manage access across a mix of corporate applications and employee-adopted SaaS services. Growth in AI tools has added new users and workflows, some of which rely on non-human identities such as service accounts and software agents. Partners are playing a larger role in helping organisations identify identity risk, secure access and apply governance beyond the limits of established IAM and identity governance and administration tools. 1Password said rising demand in its channel ecosystem helped shape the revised programme. Across the identity market, vendors are increasingly using partner programmes to broaden reach and attach implementation work, advisory services and managed offerings. In many organisations, identity and access projects cut across IT operations, security and compliance, which can favour service providers already managing directory services, device management and cloud migrations. Programme design 1Password framed the programme around a simpler global engagement model and improved deal registration incentives. The changes are intended to reduce friction and make it easier for partners to build repeatable offerings. Incentives tied to early deal registration are also designed to support net-new customer acquisition. In its announcement, 1Password pointed to what it called SaaS sprawl and the emergence of AI agents with high levels of access. It linked those trends to growing attention on accountability and trust in access decisions, and positioned the programme as a way for partners to build services revenue tied to identity security work. Larissa Crandall, Global Vice President of Channel and Alliances at 1Password, connected the move to shifting security priorities. "Security has shifted from protecting networks to protecting identity, fundamentally reshaping how businesses operate across SaaS and AI-driven environments," said Larissa Crandall, Global Vice President of Channel and Alliances, 1Password. "The expanded 1Password Partner Program reflects that shift. We're committed to investing in partners who want to lead with identity security, scale services with confidence, and grow alongside us as demand continues to accelerate," she added. Non-human identities 1Password said more than 75% of its revenue comes from businesses using its platform to manage access across SaaS and what it described as increasingly AI-powered workflows. It also said organisations are extending access to non-human identities and autonomous systems, changing expectations for identity governance. The company markets an "Extended Access Management" suite that includes password management and tools focused on access governance for SaaS applications, including those not managed by IT. It also referenced "Agentic AI" features that it said extend identity security to AI agents and other non-human identities. Service providers have started to treat non-human identities as a distinct governance problem. Many organisations already use machine identities across cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines and integrations. Increased use of automation and AI tooling can add more identities, credentials and permissions, creating new audit and access review requirements for security teams. Optiv said it sees identity as central to managing cyber risk in AI-led environments. "As businesses increasingly operate across SaaS and AI-driven environments, identity has emerged as a defining factor in how cyber risk is managed," said Scott Goree, Senior Vice President, Partners, Alliances and Ecosystems, Optiv. "1Password enables our teams to help clients establish stronger identity governance without slowing the business, particularly as non-human identities and automation introduce new complexity. That foundation allows us to design and operate identity security programs that scale with how modern organizations work," he added. Distribution partner TD SYNNEX pointed to the programme's structure and its fit with services delivery. "Our partnership with 1Password strengthens our ability to make identity security a core part of our security strategy," said Scott Young, SVP, Vendor Management, TD SYNNEX. "The program structure directly supports how we build, scale, and deliver security services for our customers, enabling us to better meet their evolving identity security needs," added Young. Westcon-Comstor described the initiative as a route to increased partner activity in EMEA. "Our collaboration with 1Password goes from strength to strength, driven by a shared commitment to helping channel partners capture fast-growing opportunities in identity security," said Daniel Hurel. "By combining 1Password's leadership in identity security with Westcon-Comstor's enablement, insights and reach, we're equipping partners across EMEA to accelerate adoption, unlock new revenue streams and deliver real, measurable value to their customers," added Hurel.

We're committed to investing in partners who want to lead with identity security, scale services with confidence, and grow alongside us as demand continues to accelerate," she added. 1Password said more than 75% of its revenue comes from businesses using its platform to manage access across SaaS and what it described as increasingly AI-powered workflows. It also said organisations are extending access to non-human identities and autonomous systems, changing expectations for identity governance. The company markets an "Extended Access Management" suite that includes password management and tools focused on access governance for SaaS applications, including those not managed by IT. It also referenced "Agentic AI" features that it said extend identity security to AI agents and other non-human identities. Service providers have started to treat non-human identities as a distinct governance problem. Many organisations already use machine identities across cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines and integrations. Increased use of automation and AI tooling can add more identities, credentials and permissions, creating new audit and access review requirements for security teams. Optiv said it sees identity as central to managing cyber risk in AI-led environments. "As businesses increasingly operate across SaaS and AI-driven environments, identity has emerged as a defining factor in how cyber risk is managed," said Scott Goree, Senior Vice President, Partners, Alliances and Ecosystems, Optiv. "1Password enables our teams to help clients establish stronger identity governance without slowing the business, particularly as non-human identities and automation introduce new complexity. That foundation allows us to design and operate identity security programs that scale with how modern organizations work," he added. Distribution partner TD SYNNEX pointed to the programme's structure and its fit with services delivery. "Our partnership with 1Password strengthens our ability to make identity security a core part of our security strategy," said Scott Young, SVP, Vendor Management, TD SYNNEX. "The program structure directly supports how we build, scale, and deliver security services for our customers, enabling us to better meet their evolving identity security needs," added Young. Westcon-Comstor described the initiative as a route to increased partner activity in EMEA. "Our collaboration with 1Password goes from strength to strength, driven by a shared commitment to helping channel partners capture fast-growing opportunities in identity security," said Daniel Hurel. "By combining 1Password's leadership in identity security with Westcon-Comstor's enablement, insights and reach, we're equipping partners across EMEA to accelerate adoption, unlock new revenue streams and deliver real, measurable value to their customers," added Hurel.
