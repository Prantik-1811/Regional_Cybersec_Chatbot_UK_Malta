Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Threat Modelling & Assessment We help clients understand the threats they face in the environment they operate in, the organisations they work with, & the technology they use. The foundation of effective cyber resilience. Understanding the threats you face is a fundamental step towards designing, implementing, and testing an effective security solution. CYSIAM's Threat Modelling methodology maps out how your organisation looks from the outside, but also where you may be vulnerable from within. An external threat could be identified due to the work you do or who you do it for, or if you work in a country of interest to a hostile state threat actor. Internal threats are much harder to foresee, but must be considered in order to prepare effective mitigation strategies. Threats can also be associated with the technology you use, which may well be critical to your operations. Knowing what to protect and it what circumstances it could be compromised will inform your protection and detection capabilities, allow you to exercise your incident response plans in appropriate scenarios, and provide critical information to responders should the worst happen. Our Approach CYSIAM Threat Modelling begins with defining the scope and understanding the system architecture, including assets, data flows, and trust boundaries. By decomposing the system into components, our team will identify potential attack surfaces and classify threats using structured frameworks (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK). This helps uncover vulnerabilities such as spoofing, information leakage, or privilege escalation, which may not be obvious during standard development or operational reviews. The findings are then documented in a threat model report, reviewed with stakeholders, and used to guide development or system improvements. Threat modelling is not a one-time task but should be continuously updated as systems evolve or new threats emerge, ensuring ongoing resilience and risk awareness. All CYSIAM Managed Detection & Response (MDR) service engagements begin with an appropriate level of Threat Modelling. Benefits Threat modelling offers several key benefits that enhance the security and resilience of organisations, especially when integrated early in the design of security and incident response strategies: Proactive Risk Identification: It helps teams identify potential threats and vulnerabilities before they are exploited, allowing for preventive action rather than reactive patching after an incident. Cross-Team Collaboration: It encourages communication between information technology and security teams, and business stakeholders, fostering a shared understanding of risks and responsibilities. Regulatory and Compliance: Many standards (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST, GDPR) encourage or require risk assessments — threat modelling provides a structured way to demonstrate due diligence. Continuous Security Awareness: Regular threat modelling keeps teams engaged with evolving threats and ensures security remains a part of ongoing system maintenance and evolution.
