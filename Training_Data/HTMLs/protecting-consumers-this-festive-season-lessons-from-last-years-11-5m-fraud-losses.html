News The festive season is upon us! Streets are glowing with twinkling lights, high streets are bustling with holiday cheer, and inboxes are brimming with enticing offers. But behind the glitter and glow lies a stark reality: cybercriminals are also gearing up for the holidays, and last year, UK shoppers lost a staggering £11.5 million to online fraud during this period. As early Christmas shopping begins, with many places celebrating their light switch-ons and seasonal promotions already in full swing, it’s crucial to protect ourselves from these cunning Grinches. A Wake-Up Call from Last Year According to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), fraudsters use the Christmas rush to exploit busy shoppers eager to snag deals. Fake websites, phishing emails, and counterfeit goods surged last year, leaving thousands of consumers out of pocket and dampening their holiday spirits. The scams varied – from online marketplaces selling “luxury” gifts at unbelievable prices to phishing schemes that mimicked trusted retailers. Often, people only realised the deception after their money was gone or their personal information was stolen. But this year can be different. With a bit of awareness and a few savvy strategies, you can outsmart even the most determined fraudsters. Top Tips to Stay Safe This Festive Season Here are actionable tips to help you shop smart and protect your finances during the busiest shopping time of the year: 1. Shop from Trusted Sources Only Stick to well-known retailers or verified websites. If you’re tempted by an offer from an unfamiliar site, double-check its legitimacy. Look for “https://” in the URL and read online reviews before making a purchase. 2. Be Wary of Deals Too Good to Be True If an offer looks too good to be true, it probably is. Scammers often lure shoppers with heavily discounted luxury goods that don’t exist. Trust your instincts – high discounts on high-demand products should raise a red flag. 3. Avoid Clicking on Suspicious Links Phishing emails spike during the holidays. These emails often claim to be from popular brands or delivery services, urging you to “verify your account” or “track your package.” Always go directly to the company’s website instead of clicking on links in emails. 4. Use Secure Payment Methods Pay using secure options like credit cards or payment platforms with buyer protection. Avoid direct bank transfers, as they’re harder to trace and recover in case of fraud. 5. Strengthen Your Cyber Defences Update your device software, use strong passwords, and enable two-factor authentication wherever possible. These steps can protect you from hackers seeking to exploit vulnerabilities. 6. Watch Out for Fake Charities The holiday season is also a time for giving, and scammers know this. If donating to charity, verify the organisation’s legitimacy through the Charity Commission website. 7. Monitor Bank Statements Regularly Check your bank and credit card statements frequently to spot any unauthorised transactions. The sooner you catch a fraudulent charge, the quicker you can act. The Human Element: Vigilance is Key Beyond technology, staying alert is your best defence. Many scams succeed because they exploit emotions – urgency, excitement, or goodwill. Pause and think before making any online transaction, especially when pressured by “time-limited offers” or emotionally charged appeals. Spread the Word: Stay Ahead of the Scammers The NCSC is urging consumers to share awareness with family and friends, especially those less tech-savvy who might be at higher risk. Make it part of your Christmas preparations to talk about staying safe online, just like you would discuss travel plans or gift ideas. Make This Festive Season Safe and Joyful The festive season should be about joy, connection, and celebration – not financial stress or fraud worries. By staying vigilant and following these simple precautions, you can enjoy the holiday cheer without falling victim to scams.

Scammers often lure shoppers with heavily discounted luxury goods that don’t exist. Trust your instincts – high discounts on high-demand products should raise a red flag. 3. Avoid Clicking on Suspicious Links Phishing emails spike during the holidays. These emails often claim to be from popular brands or delivery services, urging you to “verify your account” or “track your package.” Always go directly to the company’s website instead of clicking on links in emails. 4. Use Secure Payment Methods Pay using secure options like credit cards or payment platforms with buyer protection. Avoid direct bank transfers, as they’re harder to trace and recover in case of fraud. 5. Strengthen Your Cyber Defences Update your device software, use strong passwords, and enable two-factor authentication wherever possible. These steps can protect you from hackers seeking to exploit vulnerabilities. 6. Watch Out for Fake Charities The holiday season is also a time for giving, and scammers know this. If donating to charity, verify the organisation’s legitimacy through the Charity Commission website. 7. Monitor Bank Statements Regularly Check your bank and credit card statements frequently to spot any unauthorised transactions. The sooner you catch a fraudulent charge, the quicker you can act. The Human Element: Vigilance is Key Beyond technology, staying alert is your best defence. Many scams succeed because they exploit emotions – urgency, excitement, or goodwill. Pause and think before making any online transaction, especially when pressured by “time-limited offers” or emotionally charged appeals. Spread the Word: Stay Ahead of the Scammers The NCSC is urging consumers to share awareness with family and friends, especially those less tech-savvy who might be at higher risk. Make it part of your Christmas preparations to talk about staying safe online, just like you would discuss travel plans or gift ideas. Make This Festive Season Safe and Joyful The festive season should be about joy, connection, and celebration – not financial stress or fraud worries. By staying vigilant and following these simple precautions, you can enjoy the holiday cheer without falling victim to scams.

Streets are glowing with twinkling lights, high streets are bustling with holiday cheer, and inboxes are brimming with enticing offers. But behind the glitter and glow lies a stark reality: cybercriminals are also gearing up for the holidays, and last year, UK shoppers lost a staggering £11.5 million to online fraud during this period. As early Christmas shopping begins, with many places celebrating their light switch-ons and seasonal promotions already in full swing, it’s crucial to protect ourselves from these cunning Grinches. A Wake-Up Call from Last Year According to the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), fraudsters use the Christmas rush to exploit busy shoppers eager to snag deals. Fake websites, phishing emails, and counterfeit goods surged last year, leaving thousands of consumers out of pocket and dampening their holiday spirits. The scams varied – from online marketplaces selling “luxury” gifts at unbelievable prices to phishing schemes that mimicked trusted retailers. Often, people only realised the deception after their money was gone or their personal information was stolen. But this year can be different. With a bit of awareness and a few savvy strategies, you can outsmart even the most determined fraudsters. Top Tips to Stay Safe This Festive Season Here are actionable tips to help you shop smart and protect your finances during the busiest shopping time of the year: 1. Shop from Trusted Sources Only Stick to well-known retailers or verified websites. If you’re tempted by an offer from an unfamiliar site, double-check its legitimacy. Look for “https://” in the URL and read online reviews before making a purchase. 2. Be Wary of Deals Too Good to Be True If an offer looks too good to be true, it probably is. Scammers often lure shoppers with heavily discounted luxury goods that don’t exist. Trust your instincts – high discounts on high-demand products should raise a red flag. 3.
