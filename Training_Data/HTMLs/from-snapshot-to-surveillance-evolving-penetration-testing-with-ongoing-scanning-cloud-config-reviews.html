News Pen Testing Annual penetration tests are a great start. But in today’s world of cloud drift, zero-day exploits, stolen credentials on the dark web, and AI-assisted threats, they’re just that – a start. To stay ahead, organisations need to move from a point-in-time snapshot to continuous assurance : combining pen testing with ongoing vulnerability scanning, cloud configuration reviews, and dark web monitoring. Why Once-a-Year Testing Isn’t Enough Penetration testing remains critical for: Meeting compliance (PCI DSS, ISO 27001, Cyber Essentials, etc.) Identifying vulnerabilities before attackers do Demonstrating how real-world attack paths unfold But there’s a catch: most pen tests provide a single snapshot in time . And today’s threat landscape? It changes by the hour. If you’re only testing once a year, you may be leaving your organisation exposed for the other 11 months. The Case for Ongoing Vulnerability Scanning Think of it as keeping pen testing in rhythm with your business. Vulnerability scanning helps you: Spot newly disclosed CVEs as soon as they appear Catch misconfigurations in your internet-facing systems Reduce exposure time by remediating in days, not months Best practice: run scans monthly or quarterly , depending on your risk profile and rate of change. On its own, automated scanning creates noise. But when paired with expert validation and prioritised remediation guidance, it becomes a powerful extension of your security program. Dark Web Monitoring: Early Warning for Hidden Risks Would you know if your staff credentials or company data were for sale on the dark web? Dark web monitoring gives you: Early detection of leaked usernames & passwords Warnings of stolen customer data or insider access being traded A chance to act before attackers exploit the information Best practice: monitor continuously (or at least quarterly). It’s a simple way to reduce the risk of credential stuffing and targeted phishing attacks. Cloud Configuration Reviews: Closing the Gaps Scanners Miss Cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, GCP, and Microsoft 365 are fast and scalable – but dangerously easy to misconfigure. From public storage buckets to weak IAM policies, misconfigurations remain one of the leading causes of data breaches. Our reviews uncover issues such as: Open storage accessible to the internet Excessive permissions or shadow admins Disabled logging and audit trails Weak MFA and Conditional Access policies Unlike pen testing, which simulates an attack, config reviews dig into policy-level weaknesses that attackers actively look for. Pen Testing + Scanning + Monitoring = Continuous Assurance Annual penetration tests aren’t obsolete – they’re essential. But forward-thinking organisations are layering in ongoing scanning, dark web monitoring, and cloud reviews to strengthen assurance between those yearly tests.

From customer service bots to productivity assistants, organisations are racing to... 24 November 2025 Annual penetration tests are a great start. But in today’s world of cloud drift, zero-day exploits, stolen credentials on the dark web, and AI-assisted threats, they’re just that – a start. To stay ahead, organisations need to move from a point-in-time snapshot to continuous assurance : combining pen testing with ongoing vulnerability scanning, cloud configuration reviews, and dark web monitoring. Why Once-a-Year Testing Isn’t Enough Penetration testing remains critical for: Meeting compliance (PCI DSS, ISO 27001, Cyber Essentials, etc.) Identifying vulnerabilities before attackers do Demonstrating how real-world attack paths unfold But there’s a catch: most pen tests provide a single snapshot in time . And today’s threat landscape? It changes by the hour. If you’re only testing once a year, you may be leaving your organisation exposed for the other 11 months. The Case for Ongoing Vulnerability Scanning Think of it as keeping pen testing in rhythm with your business. Vulnerability scanning helps you: Spot newly disclosed CVEs as soon as they appear Catch misconfigurations in your internet-facing systems Reduce exposure time by remediating in days, not months Best practice: run scans monthly or quarterly , depending on your risk profile and rate of change. On its own, automated scanning creates noise. But when paired with expert validation and prioritised remediation guidance, it becomes a powerful extension of your security program. Dark Web Monitoring: Early Warning for Hidden Risks Would you know if your staff credentials or company data were for sale on the dark web? Dark web monitoring gives you: Early detection of leaked usernames & passwords Warnings of stolen customer data or insider access being traded A chance to act before attackers exploit the information Best practice: monitor continuously (or at least quarterly). It’s a simple way to reduce the risk of credential stuffing and targeted phishing attacks. Cloud Configuration Reviews: Closing the Gaps Scanners Miss Cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, GCP, and Microsoft 365 are fast and scalable – but dangerously easy to misconfigure. From public storage buckets to weak IAM policies, misconfigurations remain one of the leading causes of data breaches. Our reviews uncover issues such as: Open storage accessible to the internet Excessive permissions or shadow admins Disabled logging and audit trails Weak MFA and Conditional Access policies Unlike pen testing, which simulates an attack, config reviews dig into policy-level weaknesses that attackers actively look for. Pen Testing + Scanning + Monitoring = Continuous Assurance Annual penetration tests aren’t obsolete – they’re essential. But forward-thinking organisations are layering in ongoing scanning, dark web monitoring, and cloud reviews to strengthen assurance between those yearly tests. Traditional Pen Test Continuous Assurance Snapshot in time Ongoing situational awareness Compliance-driven Risk reduction-focused May miss cloud issues Cloud-first by design Annual Monthly or quarterly What This Means for You CISOs : real-time visibility of risk, not stale data IT teams : faster remediation cycles, fewer fire drills Compliance leads : ongoing evidence, not last-minute scrambles Execs & Boards : measurable improvement over time Ready to Level Up Your Testing Program? At CyberCrowd, we help organisations combine: Annual penetration testing for assurance and compliance Monthly or quarterly vulnerability scans to catch emerging risks Dark web monitoring for early-warning intelligence Cloud configuration reviews to tackle misconfiguration risks head-on Contact us to book a discovery call: info@cybercrowd.co.uk Or speak to your account manager: 0203 858 7372 Key Takeaways: Annual pen tests are valuable, but they only give a snapshot Ongoing vulnerability scanning = continuous risk visibility Dark web monitoring = early detection of leaked credentials/data Cloud configuration reviews = protection against the #1 cause of cloud breaches Together, they create true continuous cyber resilience Annual penetration tests are a great start.
