IBM- QRadar/QRoC and Randori 01 IBM's QRadar on Cloud gives the freedom for our team to make customisations for our customers and intuitive rule modifications with scalability for any size enterprise and allows for custom log parsing for even the most bespoke of tools. LEARN MORE 01 IBM QRadar 02 QRadar SIEM uses AI, network, and user behaviour analytics, along with real-world threat intelligence, analysts are empowered with more accurate, contextualised, and prioritised alerts. LEARN MORE 02 IBM QRadar 03 30% of assets are unknown or unmanaged due to rapid transformation, Randori helps to mitigate this. Organisations have done a good job of finding and fixing known vulnerabilities on managed organisational assets. But the rapid adoption of hybrid cloud models and the permanent support of a remote workforce have made it impossible for security to manage the expansion of the enterprise attack surface. LEARN MORE 03 Randori 04 Randori Recon uses a continuous, accurate discovery process to uncover shadow IT and gets you on target quickly with correlated, factual findings that are based on adversarial temptation. The streamlined workflows improve your overall resiliency through integrations with your existing security ecosystem.
