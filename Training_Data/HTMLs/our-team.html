A child of the 1960’s, he agrees with legendary author, Douglas Adams, that digital watches were a pretty neat idea. By the 1980’s Owen was learning how to code using C and by the turn of the century, he was teaching HTML to enthusiastic youngsters. These days, Owen can be found pestering editors for new technology to review on an annoyingly regular basis. In his spare time, he rides motorcycles of the three-wheeled variety, studies theology, aqua-jogs, and works hard to honour his late wife’s request to live a joy-filled life.
