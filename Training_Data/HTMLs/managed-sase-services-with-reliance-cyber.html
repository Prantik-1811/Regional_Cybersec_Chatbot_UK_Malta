Our managed SASE service powered by Cato Networks can typically be deployed within 2 days using our Infrastructure-as-Code approach. This includes SASE technology deployment, policy deployment and service integration. What’s included in 24/7 monitoring? Our UK-based, SC-cleared SOC provides continuous monitoring of your SASE environment, including threat detection and incident response while our NOC Continuously manages policy enforcement and performance monitoring. How does SASE reduce costs compared to traditional networking? SASE eliminates the need for multiple point solutions, reduces MPLS costs by up to 50%, minimises hardware requirements, and significantly reduces operational overhead through centralised management. What happens to our existing security technologies? We provide a comprehensive roadmap strategy that can help with migration of existing security technologies, by consolidating your security technologies your redundant solutions are no longer required and therefore reduce complexity and cost.
