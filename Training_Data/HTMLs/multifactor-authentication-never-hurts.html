News Cybersecurity Awareness Month Blog #2 October is Cybersecurity Awareness Month , and we’re continuing our mission to help everyone – individuals and organisations alike – Stay Safe Online . Last week, we talked about the power of strong passwords and password managers (if you missed it, check out My password needs to be how long? ). This week, we’re turning our attention to the next simple – yet incredibly powerful – step in online protection: Multifactor Authentication (MFA). What is MFA? Multifactor Authentication adds an extra layer of security to your accounts beyond just a password. It works by requiring two or more forms of verification – something you know (like your password), and something you have (like a phone, app, or fingerprint). So even if a cybercriminal steals or guesses your password, they still can’t access your account without that second factor. Think of it like locking your front door – and then adding an alarm system. MFA Never Hurts – But a Hacked Account Does Setting up MFA takes only a few minutes. Regaining control of a hacked account? That can take hours, days – or sometimes never. When you enable MFA, you disable the hackers. Even quick solutions like text-based codes are a strong defence, but not all MFA methods are created equal. Not All MFA Is the Same! The NCA’s “MFA Fan Club” sums it up perfectly – MFA is so dreamy… so secure… so multiple! Here’s their MFA ranking, from Superior to Fail : Grade Type Why It Matters S (SUPERIOR) Biometrics (Face ID, fingerprint scans) Hard to fake and unique to you. Standalone MFA apps (Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Duo) Strong encryption and reliable protection. A (EXCELLENT) Hardware MFA device Strong protection, though the device could be lost or stolen. B (GOOD) Text message codes or links Convenient but vulnerable to SIM swap scams. Email codes or links Security depends on how secure your email account is. C (AVERAGE) Security questions Often easy to guess or find online. F (FAIL) No MFA at all Any MFA is better than none! Even a few extra seconds to approve a login can make the difference between safe access and a security incident . Why MFA Matters for Everyone – and Every Business For individuals, MFA means peace of mind. It protects your personal data, finances, and digital identity from being hijacked. For businesses, it’s a front-line defence against breaches . Cybercriminals often gain entry not by “hacking in” but by logging in with stolen credentials. MFA blocks that route. Implementing MFA across your organisation helps: Protect sensitive data and systems Prevent credential theft and phishing-based attacks Build trust with customers and partners Reduce recovery time and costs if an incident does occur It’s one of the simplest, most cost-effective ways to boost your security posture overnight . Quick Tip Enable MFA on every account that offers it – from email and social media to banking, collaboration tools, and your business systems. It might add a few seconds to your login, but it can save you hours (and headaches) if an attacker tries to break in. Stay Safe Online Cybersecurity Awareness Month is all about small, practical actions that make a big difference . So if you’ve already strengthened your passwords, your next step is clear – turn on MFA wherever you can. At CyberCrowd , we help organisations take these everyday security steps further, building proactive defences and long-term resilience through services like our Managed SOC , threat monitoring , and user awareness training. Because when it comes to cybersecurity, the strongest protection starts with people. Learn more about how we help businesses stay secure: Get in touch – we’d love to chat!

Last week, we talked about the power of strong passwords and password managers (if you missed it, check out My password needs to be how long? ). This week, we’re turning our attention to the next simple – yet incredibly powerful – step in online protection: Multifactor Authentication (MFA). What is MFA? Multifactor Authentication adds an extra layer of security to your accounts beyond just a password. It works by requiring two or more forms of verification – something you know (like your password), and something you have (like a phone, app, or fingerprint). So even if a cybercriminal steals or guesses your password, they still can’t access your account without that second factor. Think of it like locking your front door – and then adding an alarm system. MFA Never Hurts – But a Hacked Account Does Setting up MFA takes only a few minutes. Regaining control of a hacked account? That can take hours, days – or sometimes never. When you enable MFA, you disable the hackers. Even quick solutions like text-based codes are a strong defence, but not all MFA methods are created equal. Not All MFA Is the Same! The NCA’s “MFA Fan Club” sums it up perfectly – MFA is so dreamy… so secure… so multiple! Here’s their MFA ranking, from Superior to Fail : Grade Type Why It Matters S (SUPERIOR) Biometrics (Face ID, fingerprint scans) Hard to fake and unique to you. Standalone MFA apps (Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Duo) Strong encryption and reliable protection. A (EXCELLENT) Hardware MFA device Strong protection, though the device could be lost or stolen. B (GOOD) Text message codes or links Convenient but vulnerable to SIM swap scams. Email codes or links Security depends on how secure your email account is. C (AVERAGE) Security questions Often easy to guess or find online. F (FAIL) No MFA at all Any MFA is better than none! Even a few extra seconds to approve a login can make the difference between safe access and a security incident . Why MFA Matters for Everyone – and Every Business For individuals, MFA means peace of mind. It protects your personal data, finances, and digital identity from being hijacked. For businesses, it’s a front-line defence against breaches . Cybercriminals often gain entry not by “hacking in” but by logging in with stolen credentials. MFA blocks that route. Implementing MFA across your organisation helps: Protect sensitive data and systems Prevent credential theft and phishing-based attacks Build trust with customers and partners Reduce recovery time and costs if an incident does occur It’s one of the simplest, most cost-effective ways to boost your security posture overnight . Quick Tip Enable MFA on every account that offers it – from email and social media to banking, collaboration tools, and your business systems. It might add a few seconds to your login, but it can save you hours (and headaches) if an attacker tries to break in. Stay Safe Online Cybersecurity Awareness Month is all about small, practical actions that make a big difference . So if you’ve already strengthened your passwords, your next step is clear – turn on MFA wherever you can. At CyberCrowd , we help organisations take these everyday security steps further, building proactive defences and long-term resilience through services like our Managed SOC , threat monitoring , and user awareness training. Because when it comes to cybersecurity, the strongest protection starts with people. Learn more about how we help businesses stay secure: Get in touch – we’d love to chat!
