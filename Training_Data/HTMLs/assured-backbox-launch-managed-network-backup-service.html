SecurityBrief UK - Technology news for CISOs & cybersecurity decision-makers United Kingdom Guides # cloud security # cybersecurity # endpoint protection # firewalls # ransomware Search # Firewalls # Data Protection # DR Assured, BackBox launch managed network backup service Wed, 4th Feb 2026 By Mark Tarre, News Chief Assured Data Protection has launched a managed service for backing up and restoring configurations for network and security devices, through a partnership with BackBox. The service, called Assured Backup with BackBox, focuses on configurations for equipment such as firewalls, switches and routers. It targets recovery after cyber incidents, outages and hardware failures. Assured said the service automates backup and version control for more than 5,000 network and security device types. It stores configuration versions in an encrypted off-site repository. Assured said the system can restore devices back to a known good state. Assured positioned the service around a gap it sees in many resilience programmes. The company said organisations often protect data and applications, but treat network configuration recovery as a manual process. It said this can extend downtime during an incident. "Customers rely on network-connected devices every second of every day, yet many have no proven plan to recover them," said Tony Giannini, Vice President, Global Innovation, Assured Data Protection. "Replacing a switch, firewall, or router can take two to eight hours per device, and even longer during a crisis. With this service, we can restore exact configurations almost instantly. For customers with dozens or hundreds of devices, the time and cost savings are enormous," said Giannini. Configuration risks Assured said network and security devices sit at the centre of digital operations, yet many organisations store configurations manually. It said teams often keep files in inconsistent formats or in unencrypted local locations. That approach can increase risk during cyberattacks, device failures and natural disasters, according to Assured. The company linked the issue to extended downtime and higher external support costs. It also cited complex rebuild processes that rely on manual steps. Assured said the managed service applies policy-based protection and version control. It said the tooling captures configuration changes. It also said it reduces reliance on value-added resellers and consultants during incident response. Partner approach BackBox supplies the technology behind the service. Assured described BackBox as a provider of network cyber resilience solutions. The two companies said they will deliver the offering as a managed service. "Most organizations have robust data backup strategies but limited visibility into or control over the configurations that keep their networks running," said Rekha Shenoy, CEO, BackBox. "Our partnership with Assured offers customers a simple, automated, and highly cost-effective way to protect their network and security infrastructure. Combined with Assured's managed service expertise, it delivers a new level of resilience to an area where many enterprises remain exposed," said Shenoy. Broader portfolio Assured said the BackBox service extends its cyber resilience platform beyond data backup and disaster recovery into network infrastructure. The company already offers managed services built around other vendors' products, including Rubrik for backup, Nutanix DRaaS, and Zerto for rapid disaster recovery. Assured described the Zerto-related service as aimed at organisations with diverse hypervisors and demanding recovery objectives. It referenced aggressive RPOs and RTOs across compute and storage platforms. The company also outlined routes to market for the new service. Assured said it will sell to enterprises directly. It also said it will work with managed service providers and technology service providers. Giannini said the partnership adds coverage for an area that has received less attention in many recovery plans. "BackBox fills a critical, previously underserved layer of the stack," said Giannini. "It strengthens our customers' overall cyber resilience posture and gives our partners a new way to enhance their managed services," said Giannini. Assured said Assured Backup with BackBox is available now.
