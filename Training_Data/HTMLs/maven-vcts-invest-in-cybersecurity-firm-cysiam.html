Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Cyber-attacks on Law Firms Reserve a spot We are pleased to announce our upcoming free 60-minute Panel Discussion. The online event will take place on 21 st March 2023 from 12:00-13:00 , where our panel of legal and cyber experts will explore how law firms can protect against cyber-attacks, detect suspicious activity, and know how to properly respond. The contributors on this panel will include: James Cassidy – Bevan Brittan - Partner and Head of Information Law & Privacy, Co-lead on Digital Health Mark Day – Law South Group Limited - Chief Executive Officer Bethan Griffiths – RPC - Senior Associate for Cyber, Technology and Data Protection David Allan – CYSIAM , UK-based 24/7 Managed Security partner - Managing Director and CTO We know that reputation is important to law firms, however, so do the attackers. We see an increase in extortion in the legal sector due to the economies of scale that an attacker can gain from compromising the sensitive client data or trust that is critical to law firms. The opportunity to exploit the legal sector has grown with the accelerated adoption of digital technologies in a historically paper-based sector. This, along with the increased sophistication of cyber criminals, means the threat to the UK legal sector is high.
