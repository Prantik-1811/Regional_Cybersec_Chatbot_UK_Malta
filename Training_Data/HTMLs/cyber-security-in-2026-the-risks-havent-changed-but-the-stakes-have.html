News As we move into 2026, cyber security headlines feel familiar. Ransomware. Data breaches. Supply chain risk. AI-driven attacks. And yet, despite years of guidance, frameworks, tooling and regulation, organisations across the UK from small businesses to large enterprises are still being disrupted in surprisingly similar ways. The uncomfortable truth is this: the core threats haven’t fundamentally changed . What has changed is the impact – financially, operationally and reputationally – and the widening gap between what organisations believe they’re prepared for and what actually happens when something goes wrong. Based on what we’re consistently seeing across UK government guidance, insurers, incident response activity and real conversations with organisations every day, these are the cyber security themes shaping early 2026 – and why they matter. 1. Ransomware Hasn’t Evolved – But Its Impact Has Ransomware is no longer a “new” threat. The techniques are understood. The playbooks are familiar. And yet, ransomware incidents continue to dominate business disruption across the UK. What’s changed isn’t the attack – it’s the fallout . Many organisations now discover that: Backups exist, but restore times were wildly underestimated Critical systems can’t be recovered in isolation Operational downtime creates knock-on effects far beyond IT Customers, regulators and insurers expect answers immediately Insurers are scrutinising resilience far more closely. It’s no longer enough to say, “we have backups” . Organisations are being asked how quickly they can recover, who makes decisions during an incident, and whether controls like MFA and monitoring were consistently applied before the attack. For SMEs, ransomware remains especially damaging not because they’re careless, but because recovery often depends on a small number of people wearing many hats. In 2026, ransomware resilience is as much about operational planning as it is about security tooling. 2. Identity Is the Real Perimeter – And It’s Still Poorly Protected Firewalls don’t fail – credentials do . Across breach investigations and near-misses alike, compromised identities remain one of the most common entry points. Phishing, credential reuse, token theft and MFA fatigue attacks continue to work because identity environments are complex, inconsistent and often poorly monitored. Common gaps we still see include: MFA applied to some users, but not all Legacy or dormant accounts overlooked Service accounts with excessive permissions Third-party access not regularly reviewed As organisations continue to operate in hybrid and cloud-first environments, identity has become the true perimeter. Yet many organisations still protect it as an afterthought. The result? One compromised inbox can quickly turn into lateral movement, privilege escalation and full environment access often without triggering an immediate alarm. If identity isn’t being actively monitored, it’s not being protected. 3. AI Is Accelerating Risk Faster Than Controls Are Adapting Artificial intelligence hasn’t created entirely new cyber threats but it has amplified existing ones at speed. Attackers are using AI to: Craft more convincing phishing and social engineering Scale reconnaissance and targeting Automate attack workflows more efficiently At the same time, many organisations are adopting AI-enabled tools internally without clear governance around data use, access control or risk ownership. This creates a familiar pattern: adoption outpaces control . The challenge in 2026 isn’t whether AI should be used it’s whether organisations are honest about where it introduces new risk, and whether security teams are being given the visibility and authority to manage it effectively. 4. The Detection & Response Maturity Gap Ask most organisations whether they’d notice a cyber incident quickly, and the answer is usually “yes”. In reality, many wouldn’t. Alerts may exist but: No one is watching them 24/7 Or they’re lost in noise Or they’re noticed too late to make a meaningful difference We continue to see organisations with strong preventive controls but limited confidence in their ability to detect and respond in real time. Incident response plans exist on paper but haven’t been tested. Tabletop exercises reveal confusion around roles, escalation paths and decision-making authority. By the time an incident is recognised as serious, the attacker may have been present for days or weeks. In 2026, detection speed and response clarity are critical differentiators. 5. Compliance Is Not the Same as Resilience Frameworks and certifications play an important role. Cyber Essentials, ISO standards and policies provide structure and assurance but they do not stop incidents on their own. We’re still seeing organisations confuse compliance with readiness . Passing an audit doesn’t guarantee: You’ll spot an attack early You’ll respond decisively under pressure Your people know what to do at 2am on a Sunday Regulators and insurers are increasingly shifting their focus from what you have to how it actually works . Questions around detection capability, response ownership and real-world testing are becoming harder to avoid. Compliance should be seen as a foundation , not a finish line. What This Means for Organisations in 2026 The organisations coping best with cyber risk in 2026 aren’t necessarily the ones with the most tools or the longest policy documents. They’re the ones with clarity : Clear visibility of their environment Clear ownership when something goes wrong Clear understanding of what truly matters to protect Whether you’re an SME or a large enterprise, the fundamentals remain the same. But the cost of getting them wrong – operationally, financially and reputationally – is higher than ever. Cyber security isn’t about chasing every new headline – it’s about understanding what really increases risk for your organisation. If any of these themes resonate, or you’d like to explore how they apply in practice, feel free to get in touch . We’re always happy to talk.

Compliance Is Not the Same as Resilience Frameworks and certifications play an important role. Cyber Essentials, ISO standards and policies provide structure and assurance but they do not stop incidents on their own. We’re still seeing organisations confuse compliance with readiness . Passing an audit doesn’t guarantee: You’ll spot an attack early You’ll respond decisively under pressure Your people know what to do at 2am on a Sunday Regulators and insurers are increasingly shifting their focus from what you have to how it actually works . Questions around detection capability, response ownership and real-world testing are becoming harder to avoid. Compliance should be seen as a foundation , not a finish line. What This Means for Organisations in 2026 The organisations coping best with cyber risk in 2026 aren’t necessarily the ones with the most tools or the longest policy documents. They’re the ones with clarity : Clear visibility of their environment Clear ownership when something goes wrong Clear understanding of what truly matters to protect Whether you’re an SME or a large enterprise, the fundamentals remain the same. But the cost of getting them wrong – operationally, financially and reputationally – is higher than ever. Cyber security isn’t about chasing every new headline – it’s about understanding what really increases risk for your organisation.

Ransomware. Data breaches. Supply chain risk. AI-driven attacks. And yet, despite years of guidance, frameworks, tooling and regulation, organisations across the UK from small businesses to large enterprises are still being disrupted in surprisingly similar ways. The uncomfortable truth is this: the core threats haven’t fundamentally changed . What has changed is the impact – financially, operationally and reputationally – and the widening gap between what organisations believe they’re prepared for and what actually happens when something goes wrong. Based on what we’re consistently seeing across UK government guidance, insurers, incident response activity and real conversations with organisations every day, these are the cyber security themes shaping early 2026 – and why they matter. 1. Ransomware Hasn’t Evolved – But Its Impact Has Ransomware is no longer a “new” threat. The techniques are understood. The playbooks are familiar. And yet, ransomware incidents continue to dominate business disruption across the UK. What’s changed isn’t the attack – it’s the fallout . Many organisations now discover that: Backups exist, but restore times were wildly underestimated Critical systems can’t be recovered in isolation Operational downtime creates knock-on effects far beyond IT Customers, regulators and insurers expect answers immediately Insurers are scrutinising resilience far more closely. It’s no longer enough to say, “we have backups” . Organisations are being asked how quickly they can recover, who makes decisions during an incident, and whether controls like MFA and monitoring were consistently applied before the attack. For SMEs, ransomware remains especially damaging not because they’re careless, but because recovery often depends on a small number of people wearing many hats. In 2026, ransomware resilience is as much about operational planning as it is about security tooling. 2. Identity Is the Real Perimeter – And It’s Still Poorly Protected Firewalls don’t fail – credentials do . Across breach investigations and near-misses alike, compromised identities remain one of the most common entry points. Phishing, credential reuse, token theft and MFA fatigue attacks continue to work because identity environments are complex, inconsistent and often poorly monitored. Common gaps we still see include: MFA applied to some users, but not all Legacy or dormant accounts overlooked Service accounts with excessive permissions Third-party access not regularly reviewed As organisations continue to operate in hybrid and cloud-first environments, identity has become the true perimeter. Yet many organisations still protect it as an afterthought. The result? One compromised inbox can quickly turn into lateral movement, privilege escalation and full environment access often without triggering an immediate alarm. If identity isn’t being actively monitored, it’s not being protected. 3. AI Is Accelerating Risk Faster Than Controls Are Adapting Artificial intelligence hasn’t created entirely new cyber threats but it has amplified existing ones at speed. Attackers are using AI to: Craft more convincing phishing and social engineering Scale reconnaissance and targeting Automate attack workflows more efficiently At the same time, many organisations are adopting AI-enabled tools internally without clear governance around data use, access control or risk ownership. This creates a familiar pattern: adoption outpaces control . The challenge in 2026 isn’t whether AI should be used it’s whether organisations are honest about where it introduces new risk, and whether security teams are being given the visibility and authority to manage it effectively. 4. The Detection & Response Maturity Gap Ask most organisations whether they’d notice a cyber incident quickly, and the answer is usually “yes”. In reality, many wouldn’t. Alerts may exist but: No one is watching them 24/7 Or they’re lost in noise Or they’re noticed too late to make a meaningful difference We continue to see organisations with strong preventive controls but limited confidence in their ability to detect and respond in real time. Incident response plans exist on paper but haven’t been tested. Tabletop exercises reveal confusion around roles, escalation paths and decision-making authority. By the time an incident is recognised as serious, the attacker may have been present for days or weeks. In 2026, detection speed and response clarity are critical differentiators. 5.
