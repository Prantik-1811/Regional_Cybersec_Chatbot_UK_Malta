News In the ever-evolving threat landscape, Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) has emerged as a powerful enabler of cybercrime, lowering the barrier to entry for attackers and increasing the frequency, scale, and sophistication of ransomware attacks. What is Ransomware-as-a-Service? Ransomware-as-a-Service is a cybercrime business model in which ransomware developers lease their malware to affiliates. Much like legitimate software-as-a-service platforms, RaaS groups provide tools, documentation, support, and even dashboards for managing attacks and profits. Here’s how it typically works: Developers create and maintain the ransomware code. Affiliates sign up to use the service (often via darknet forums), deploy the ransomware, and conduct the actual attacks. Profits from successful ransom payments are shared, often with the developer taking a 20–30% cut. This model has democratised ransomware – enabling individuals or groups with limited technical skills to launch sophisticated attacks using professionally maintained malware. Why Has RaaS Risen in Popularity? Several factors have contributed to the rapid rise of RaaS: Low Barrier to Entry Affiliates don’t need to be skilled hackers – they just need access to initial access brokers, stolen credentials, or phishing kits. Profitability High ransom payouts, often in cryptocurrency, make this an appealing venture for financially motivated actors. Operational Efficiency Like a SaaS platform, RaaS operators offer updates, bug fixes, customer service (for affiliates and even victims), and user-friendly dashboards. Anonymity and Decentralisation RaaS platforms operate on the dark web, with transactions in Bitcoin or Monero. This decentralisation makes attribution and law enforcement action much harder. Affiliate Recruitment Many RaaS operators actively recruit affiliates – often through darknet forums or encrypted messaging platforms – with incentives, reputation systems, and even “user testimonials”. Real-World Example: Scattered Spider – A Prime Example of RaaS in Action Scattered Spider (also tracked as UNC3944 or Octo Tempest) has emerged as one of the most sophisticated and aggressive threat actor groups operating under the Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model. Known for their highly effective social engineering tactics – such as impersonating employees or IT staff – they excel at bypassing enterprise security controls to gain initial access to networks. Historically, Scattered Spider has targeted large organisations, particularly in the telecommunications, technology, and critical infrastructure sectors. A notable example of their activity includes the late 2023 breach of MGM Resorts. In this incident, they reportedly used multi-factor authentication (MFA) fatigue attacks and other social engineering methods to infiltrate systems, ultimately deploying ransomware that caused widespread operational disruption. The attack highlighted how RaaS affiliates can combine sophisticated intrusion techniques with commercial-grade malware to devastating effect. More recently, the group has expanded its focus to include retail, hospitality, and other consumer-facing industries – demonstrating a clear shift in strategy. This pivot is likely driven by the profitability and data richness of these sectors, as well as the potential to cause high-impact disruption. In early 2025, several high-profile UK retailers were targeted in incidents attributed to Scattered Spider, reinforcing the group’s willingness and ability to diversify its targets quickly and effectively. Scattered Spider is also known to collaborate with other prominent RaaS groups, such as BlackCat/ALPHV – developers of one of the most advanced ransomware strains. These partnerships allow threat actors to tailor attacks using a menu of tools, infrastructure, and extortion techniques provided by the RaaS model, making their operations more scalable and difficult to predict. Their evolving tactics are a textbook example of how the RaaS ecosystem enables agile, opportunistic attacks across industries. For organisations of all sizes, this is a stark reminder that cybercriminals are not confined to specific sectors – and that preparation, vigilance, and proactive security measures are essential to staying protected. Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) RaaS affiliates are now commonly using: Initial Access Brokers (IABs) to purchase entry into networks. Living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) to avoid detection. Active Directory exploitation , credential dumping, and lateral movement. Data exfiltration for double extortion — threatening to leak data if ransom is unpaid. Threat actor call centres , where victims are contacted by phone and pressured into paying. Implications for Organisations The rise of RaaS has made ransomware attacks: More frequent Harder to predict More damaging More industrialised Many RaaS groups now operate with: Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for affiliates Leak sites where stolen data is published if the ransom is unpaid Negotiation portals where victims are “supported” during the ransom process This professionalisation of cybercrime means no sector or organisation is immune , regardless of size or industry. What You Can Do to Protect Your Organisation Patch and Update Regularly Unpatched systems remain one of the top ways attackers gain access. Implement Zero Trust Principles Don’t assume internal traffic is safe. Use segmentation, least privilege, and verification. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) But make sure it’s properly implemented – and educate users to spot MFA fatigue. Security Awareness Training Train employees to identify phishing and social engineering attempts. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools like EDR and XDR can detect unusual behaviour and block ransomware execution. Backup and Recovery Maintain isolated backups and test your recovery processes. Threat Intelligence and Monitoring Stay informed about emerging threats, including new RaaS groups and tactics. Incident Response Planning Ensure your organisation knows how to respond if ransomware hits. Who do you contact? Do you have legal and cyber insurance coverage? Recovery and Future Trends in the RaaS Landscape Recovering from a ransomware incident increasingly requires more than just clean backups. Modern RaaS affiliates are exfiltrating data and threatening to leak or sell it, which means recovery also involves legal, reputational, and regulatory considerations. Organisations should ensure they have: Tested recovery plans that include not just data restoration but communications and legal protocols. Isolated backups that are regularly validated. Post-incident reviews to understand how the breach occurred and how defences can be hardened. Looking ahead, we expect RaaS operations to become even more modular and commoditised. With the rise of AI-assisted phishing, deepfake social engineering, and increasingly automated intrusion workflows, attackers will be able to scale faster and diversify their targets with minimal effort. We’re also seeing signs of ransomware groups targeting cloud infrastructure , managed service providers , and supply chains – a shift that could amplify the reach and impact of even a single attack. Final Thoughts Ransomware-as-a-Service represents a paradigm shift in cybercrime – professional, profitable, and pervasive. The combination of industrial-grade malware, financially motivated affiliates, and access to global infrastructure makes RaaS a persistent and growing threat. Staying ahead means not just deploying the right tools, but fostering a security-aware culture, preparing for incidents, and keeping up with threat trends.

Incident Response Planning Ensure your organisation knows how to respond if ransomware hits. Who do you contact? Do you have legal and cyber insurance coverage? Recovery and Future Trends in the RaaS Landscape Recovering from a ransomware incident increasingly requires more than just clean backups. Modern RaaS affiliates are exfiltrating data and threatening to leak or sell it, which means recovery also involves legal, reputational, and regulatory considerations. Organisations should ensure they have: Tested recovery plans that include not just data restoration but communications and legal protocols. Isolated backups that are regularly validated. Post-incident reviews to understand how the breach occurred and how defences can be hardened. Looking ahead, we expect RaaS operations to become even more modular and commoditised. With the rise of AI-assisted phishing, deepfake social engineering, and increasingly automated intrusion workflows, attackers will be able to scale faster and diversify their targets with minimal effort. We’re also seeing signs of ransomware groups targeting cloud infrastructure , managed service providers , and supply chains – a shift that could amplify the reach and impact of even a single attack. Final Thoughts Ransomware-as-a-Service represents a paradigm shift in cybercrime – professional, profitable, and pervasive. The combination of industrial-grade malware, financially motivated affiliates, and access to global infrastructure makes RaaS a persistent and growing threat. Staying ahead means not just deploying the right tools, but fostering a security-aware culture, preparing for incidents, and keeping up with threat trends.

What is Ransomware-as-a-Service? Ransomware-as-a-Service is a cybercrime business model in which ransomware developers lease their malware to affiliates. Much like legitimate software-as-a-service platforms, RaaS groups provide tools, documentation, support, and even dashboards for managing attacks and profits. Here’s how it typically works: Developers create and maintain the ransomware code. Affiliates sign up to use the service (often via darknet forums), deploy the ransomware, and conduct the actual attacks. Profits from successful ransom payments are shared, often with the developer taking a 20–30% cut. This model has democratised ransomware – enabling individuals or groups with limited technical skills to launch sophisticated attacks using professionally maintained malware. Why Has RaaS Risen in Popularity? Several factors have contributed to the rapid rise of RaaS: Low Barrier to Entry Affiliates don’t need to be skilled hackers – they just need access to initial access brokers, stolen credentials, or phishing kits. Profitability High ransom payouts, often in cryptocurrency, make this an appealing venture for financially motivated actors. Operational Efficiency Like a SaaS platform, RaaS operators offer updates, bug fixes, customer service (for affiliates and even victims), and user-friendly dashboards. Anonymity and Decentralisation RaaS platforms operate on the dark web, with transactions in Bitcoin or Monero. This decentralisation makes attribution and law enforcement action much harder. Affiliate Recruitment Many RaaS operators actively recruit affiliates – often through darknet forums or encrypted messaging platforms – with incentives, reputation systems, and even “user testimonials”. Real-World Example: Scattered Spider – A Prime Example of RaaS in Action Scattered Spider (also tracked as UNC3944 or Octo Tempest) has emerged as one of the most sophisticated and aggressive threat actor groups operating under the Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model. Known for their highly effective social engineering tactics – such as impersonating employees or IT staff – they excel at bypassing enterprise security controls to gain initial access to networks. Historically, Scattered Spider has targeted large organisations, particularly in the telecommunications, technology, and critical infrastructure sectors. A notable example of their activity includes the late 2023 breach of MGM Resorts. In this incident, they reportedly used multi-factor authentication (MFA) fatigue attacks and other social engineering methods to infiltrate systems, ultimately deploying ransomware that caused widespread operational disruption. The attack highlighted how RaaS affiliates can combine sophisticated intrusion techniques with commercial-grade malware to devastating effect. More recently, the group has expanded its focus to include retail, hospitality, and other consumer-facing industries – demonstrating a clear shift in strategy. This pivot is likely driven by the profitability and data richness of these sectors, as well as the potential to cause high-impact disruption. In early 2025, several high-profile UK retailers were targeted in incidents attributed to Scattered Spider, reinforcing the group’s willingness and ability to diversify its targets quickly and effectively. Scattered Spider is also known to collaborate with other prominent RaaS groups, such as BlackCat/ALPHV – developers of one of the most advanced ransomware strains. These partnerships allow threat actors to tailor attacks using a menu of tools, infrastructure, and extortion techniques provided by the RaaS model, making their operations more scalable and difficult to predict. Their evolving tactics are a textbook example of how the RaaS ecosystem enables agile, opportunistic attacks across industries. For organisations of all sizes, this is a stark reminder that cybercriminals are not confined to specific sectors – and that preparation, vigilance, and proactive security measures are essential to staying protected. Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) RaaS affiliates are now commonly using: Initial Access Brokers (IABs) to purchase entry into networks. Living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) to avoid detection. Active Directory exploitation , credential dumping, and lateral movement. Data exfiltration for double extortion — threatening to leak data if ransom is unpaid. Threat actor call centres , where victims are contacted by phone and pressured into paying. Implications for Organisations The rise of RaaS has made ransomware attacks: More frequent Harder to predict More damaging More industrialised Many RaaS groups now operate with: Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for affiliates Leak sites where stolen data is published if the ransom is unpaid Negotiation portals where victims are “supported” during the ransom process This professionalisation of cybercrime means no sector or organisation is immune , regardless of size or industry. What You Can Do to Protect Your Organisation Patch and Update Regularly Unpatched systems remain one of the top ways attackers gain access.

These partnerships allow threat actors to tailor attacks using a menu of tools, infrastructure, and extortion techniques provided by the RaaS model, making their operations more scalable and difficult to predict. Their evolving tactics are a textbook example of how the RaaS ecosystem enables agile, opportunistic attacks across industries. For organisations of all sizes, this is a stark reminder that cybercriminals are not confined to specific sectors – and that preparation, vigilance, and proactive security measures are essential to staying protected. Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) RaaS affiliates are now commonly using: Initial Access Brokers (IABs) to purchase entry into networks. Living-off-the-land binaries (LOLBins) to avoid detection. Active Directory exploitation , credential dumping, and lateral movement. Data exfiltration for double extortion — threatening to leak data if ransom is unpaid. Threat actor call centres , where victims are contacted by phone and pressured into paying. Implications for Organisations The rise of RaaS has made ransomware attacks: Many RaaS groups now operate with: Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for affiliates Leak sites where stolen data is published if the ransom is unpaid Negotiation portals where victims are “supported” during the ransom process This professionalisation of cybercrime means no sector or organisation is immune , regardless of size or industry. What You Can Do to Protect Your Organisation Patch and Update Regularly Unpatched systems remain one of the top ways attackers gain access. Implement Zero Trust Principles Don’t assume internal traffic is safe. Use segmentation, least privilege, and verification. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) But make sure it’s properly implemented – and educate users to spot MFA fatigue. Security Awareness Training Train employees to identify phishing and social engineering attempts. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools like EDR and XDR can detect unusual behaviour and block ransomware execution. Backup and Recovery Maintain isolated backups and test your recovery processes. Threat Intelligence and Monitoring Stay informed about emerging threats, including new RaaS groups and tactics. Incident Response Planning Ensure your organisation knows how to respond if ransomware hits. Who do you contact? Do you have legal and cyber insurance coverage? Recovery and Future Trends in the RaaS Landscape Recovering from a ransomware incident increasingly requires more than just clean backups. Modern RaaS affiliates are exfiltrating data and threatening to leak or sell it, which means recovery also involves legal, reputational, and regulatory considerations. Organisations should ensure they have: Tested recovery plans that include not just data restoration but communications and legal protocols. Isolated backups that are regularly validated. Post-incident reviews to understand how the breach occurred and how defences can be hardened. Looking ahead, we expect RaaS operations to become even more modular and commoditised. With the rise of AI-assisted phishing, deepfake social engineering, and increasingly automated intrusion workflows, attackers will be able to scale faster and diversify their targets with minimal effort. We’re also seeing signs of ransomware groups targeting cloud infrastructure , managed service providers , and supply chains – a shift that could amplify the reach and impact of even a single attack. Ransomware-as-a-Service represents a paradigm shift in cybercrime – professional, profitable, and pervasive. The combination of industrial-grade malware, financially motivated affiliates, and access to global infrastructure makes RaaS a persistent and growing threat. Staying ahead means not just deploying the right tools, but fostering a security-aware culture, preparing for incidents, and keeping up with threat trends.
