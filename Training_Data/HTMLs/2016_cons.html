Home / Blog Post / 2016 Cyber Security Conferences The information security industry loves a good conference. Sharing knowledge, chatting with old friends, meeting new ones and putting real life faces to twitter handles. While at the Cyber Security Challenge Insight Camp at Greenwich University last weekend, many students asked where they could get more information on cyber security. I mentioned a few of the conferences that I enjoy, and then decided that I would compile a list of the top UK infosec conferences (please let me know if I’ve missed any) and some key information. Hope you find it helpful. Do let me know which you’re going to attend, I’m hoping to go to most and speak at some. I’ll be adding more information as it becomes available, so watch this space for updates.
