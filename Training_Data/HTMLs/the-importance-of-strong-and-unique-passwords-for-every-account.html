News In today’s interconnected world, passwords are often the first – and sometimes only – barrier between your data and cybercriminals. But with the sheer volume of online accounts we now manage, it’s no wonder people reuse passwords or opt for easy-to-remember ones. Unfortunately, this convenience opens the door to major security risks. Creating strong, unique passwords and managing them properly is one of the simplest and most effective ways to boost your cybersecurity. Here’s what you need to know – and do – to stay safe. Why Strong Passwords Still Matter Weak or reused passwords are one of the most common causes of data breaches. If a cybercriminal gets hold of just one password in a data leak, they’ll try it elsewhere – this is known as credential stuffing . It’s fast, automated, and frighteningly effective. Reused passwords = unlocked doors. NCSC Guidance: Use Three Random Words The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) now recommends using three random words to create strong, memorable passwords – for example: “CrayonLaptopRiver” This approach strikes the right balance between security and usability – long enough to be difficult to crack, yet easy to remember. You can strengthen it further with capital letters, numbers, or symbols, like: Crayon.Laptop!River23 Avoid obvious choices like “Password123” or themed words like “SummerBeachSun” that are easier to guess or crack using wordlists. How Long Would It Take to Crack Your Password? When we talk about “crack time,” we’re referring to how long it would take a hacker or automated program to guess your password using various methods. These can include brute-force attacks (trying every possible combination), dictionary attacks (using known words or phrases), and credential stuffing (trying passwords leaked in previous data breaches). Modern hacking tools can test billions of combinations per second, so short or common passwords can be cracked almost instantly. Even a password that looks complex but has been reused or appears in a leaked database can be compromised within seconds. That’s why using long, unique, and random passwords for every account is so important. The more unpredictable and lengthier your password is, the longer it will take to crack – ranging from hours to millions of years, depending on its complexity and whether it’s been exposed in a breach. Password Type Crack Time (est.) “123456” < 1 second “Password1” < 1 second “CrayonLaptopRiver” ~centuries (offline) Random 16-character string ~millions of years Reused from breached database Instantly Hackers use powerful tools and leaked password lists – short or reused passwords don’t stand a chance. Why You Shouldn’t Share Login Credentials at Work Sharing logins seems convenient, but it creates major risks: No accountability – You can’t trace who did what. Increased breach potential – Shared credentials often get stored insecurely. No way to control access – You can’t apply specific permissions or revoke access from one individual. Best practices: Assign individual accounts with role-based access. Enforce strong password policies. Use a password manager for secure storage. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible. Building a Strong Password: What Works Best Length matters – Aim for at least 12 characters ; 16+ is even better. Randomness is key – Avoid using names, birthdays, or dictionary words. Unique for each account – Never reuse passwords, especially for banking, email, or work accounts. Use a password manager – Secure, encrypted storage with autofill capability. Password Managers: A Game-Changer Managing dozens of passwords manually? Forget it. A password manager takes the pain out of security. A password manager is a secure application that helps you generate, store, and manage your passwords – all in one encrypted vault. Instead of trying to remember dozens (or even hundreds) of logins, you only need to remember one strong master password . Here’s how a password manager works: Stores all your passwords securely behind strong encryption. Generates complex, random passwords for new accounts. Autofills login details on websites and apps, making sign-in fast and secure. Works across multiple devices and browsers . Some even monitor the dark web to alert you if your credentials are exposed in a breach. Using a password manager reduces human error, prevents password reuse, and ensures each of your accounts is protected by a unique, strong password. It’s one of the simplest and most effective tools you can use to improve your cybersecurity hygiene. Popular, trusted options include Bitwarden , 1Password , Dashlane , and Keeper – all of which offer secure cloud syncing, browser extensions, and mobile apps. Quick Tips for Better Password Habits Use 3 random words (NCSC approved) Add a few numbers or symbols if needed Avoid password reuse at all costs Don’t store passwords in browsers or on paper Enable MFA – always Final Thoughts In an age of growing cyber threats, a strong password policy isn’t optional – it’s essential. Passwords are still your first line of defence. Make them long, unique, and secure. And if you’re still using “Password123” – consider this your friendly reminder to change it now.

But with the sheer volume of online accounts we now manage, it’s no wonder people reuse passwords or opt for easy-to-remember ones. Unfortunately, this convenience opens the door to major security risks. Creating strong, unique passwords and managing them properly is one of the simplest and most effective ways to boost your cybersecurity. Here’s what you need to know – and do – to stay safe. Why Strong Passwords Still Matter Weak or reused passwords are one of the most common causes of data breaches. If a cybercriminal gets hold of just one password in a data leak, they’ll try it elsewhere – this is known as credential stuffing . It’s fast, automated, and frighteningly effective. Reused passwords = unlocked doors. NCSC Guidance: Use Three Random Words The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) now recommends using three random words to create strong, memorable passwords – for example: “CrayonLaptopRiver” This approach strikes the right balance between security and usability – long enough to be difficult to crack, yet easy to remember. You can strengthen it further with capital letters, numbers, or symbols, like: Crayon.Laptop!River23 Avoid obvious choices like “Password123” or themed words like “SummerBeachSun” that are easier to guess or crack using wordlists. How Long Would It Take to Crack Your Password? When we talk about “crack time,” we’re referring to how long it would take a hacker or automated program to guess your password using various methods. These can include brute-force attacks (trying every possible combination), dictionary attacks (using known words or phrases), and credential stuffing (trying passwords leaked in previous data breaches). Modern hacking tools can test billions of combinations per second, so short or common passwords can be cracked almost instantly. Even a password that looks complex but has been reused or appears in a leaked database can be compromised within seconds. That’s why using long, unique, and random passwords for every account is so important. The more unpredictable and lengthier your password is, the longer it will take to crack – ranging from hours to millions of years, depending on its complexity and whether it’s been exposed in a breach. Password Type Crack Time (est.) “123456” < 1 second “Password1” < 1 second “CrayonLaptopRiver” ~centuries (offline) Random 16-character string ~millions of years Reused from breached database Instantly Hackers use powerful tools and leaked password lists – short or reused passwords don’t stand a chance. Why You Shouldn’t Share Login Credentials at Work Sharing logins seems convenient, but it creates major risks: No accountability – You can’t trace who did what. Increased breach potential – Shared credentials often get stored insecurely. No way to control access – You can’t apply specific permissions or revoke access from one individual. Best practices: Assign individual accounts with role-based access. Enforce strong password policies. Use a password manager for secure storage. Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible. Building a Strong Password: What Works Best Length matters – Aim for at least 12 characters ; 16+ is even better. Randomness is key – Avoid using names, birthdays, or dictionary words. Unique for each account – Never reuse passwords, especially for banking, email, or work accounts. Use a password manager – Secure, encrypted storage with autofill capability. Password Managers: A Game-Changer Managing dozens of passwords manually? Forget it. A password manager takes the pain out of security. A password manager is a secure application that helps you generate, store, and manage your passwords – all in one encrypted vault. Instead of trying to remember dozens (or even hundreds) of logins, you only need to remember one strong master password . Here’s how a password manager works: Stores all your passwords securely behind strong encryption. Generates complex, random passwords for new accounts. Autofills login details on websites and apps, making sign-in fast and secure. Works across multiple devices and browsers . Some even monitor the dark web to alert you if your credentials are exposed in a breach.
