The financial crime technology company said it added 90 new customers during 2025, including Wells Fargo. BioCatch said three of the four largest US banks by assets now use its products. The update comes as fraud remains a growing issue for banks and their customers. UK Finance has reported losses of £629 million from fraud in the UK during the first half of 2025. BioCatch cited annual global fraud losses at around $486 billion. BioCatch said it prevented an estimated $4 billion or more in fraud during the year. It also said it now protects more than 660 million banking customers globally. The company said it processes more than 17 billion monthly user sessions across more than 1.6 billion unique devices. Mid-market push BioCatch said its mid-market partner business increased annual recurring revenue by 60% during 2025. The company said it onboarded more than 70 community banks and credit unions through Alkami. It also reported new partnerships with Alloy, Tyfone and Nasdaq Verafin. BioCatch said it expects further mid-market expansion through 2026 and beyond. BioCatch described BioCatch Connect 2.0 as an upgrade to its fraud and financial crime detection platform. It said the release consolidates its fraud detection services. The company also referenced the Align SDK and the launch of BioCatch Link as part of its platform update. BioCatch said it delivered Scams360 as the latest edition of its scam-detection tool. Regional growth BioCatch reported increases across several regions during 2025. The company said annual recurring revenue grew 40% in Asia Pacific. It said annual recurring revenue in Mexico rose by more than 50% and annual recurring revenue in Spain increased by 89%. BioCatch said nearly half of annual recurring revenue for the year came from new customers. Hiring and awards BioCatch added 128 employees during 2025. The company said its headcount now exceeds 400 across more than 20 countries. It made its first hires in Indonesia, Italy, Japan, South Africa and Thailand. The company also cited a series of industry awards during the year. These included the Datos Insights Impact award for best scam-prevention solution, Regulation Asia's anti-fraud project of the year and fraud and financial crime industry collaboration of the year, and a Frost & Sullivan global competitive strategy leadership recognition. BioCatch published 11 research reports in 2025. It highlighted work on global money mule networks, global scams, and its 2025 Dark Economy Survey. Executive view The company framed its results around rising digital fraud and regulatory requirements. It also pointed to the role of artificial intelligence in fraud attempts. "BioCatch's growth is proof that trust is becoming the defining currency of modern banking," said Gadi Mazor, CEO, BioCatch. "Financial institutions today navigate expanding and evolving regulatory pressure, the proliferation and growing sophistication of AI-powered fraud, rising consumer expectations for seamless digital experiences, and the scaling of attacks at the hands of organized crime." Mazor continued, "Success in this environment demands operational clarity, the ability to adapt quickly, and a fundamentally new approach to trust. As we look to 2026 and beyond, BioCatch will continue to push the boundaries of innovation to redefine how the world prevents fraud and financial crime." BioCatch expects continued growth in its mid-market business during 2026 and beyond.
