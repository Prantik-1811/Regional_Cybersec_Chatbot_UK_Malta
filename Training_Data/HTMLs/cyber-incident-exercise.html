Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Incident Response Cyber Incident Exercise (CIE) We bring together technical & non-technical stakeholders to practice executing crisis planning, and identify areas for improvement. Practice makes perfect...or at least better. Cyber Incident Exercises (CIE), either Table-top or Live-play, are a vital component of any organisation’s cybersecurity strategy, enabling teams to rehearse their response to realistic threat scenarios in a controlled environment. These exercises test the effectiveness of incident response plans, improve coordination between technical and non-technical staff, and help identify weaknesses before a real incident occurs. By simulating cyber attacks such as ransomware, data breaches, or phishing campaigns, organisations can refine their decision-making processes, clarify roles and responsibilities, and build confidence across all levels of the business. Regular CIEs not only enhance operational readiness but also demonstrate a proactive approach to cyber resilience, which is increasingly valued by regulators, insurers, and stakeholders alike. Our Approach CYSIAM adopts a comprehensive, intelligence-led approach to Cyber Incident Exercising (CIE), tailored to bolster your organisation's resilience against cyber threats. As an NCSC Assured Service Provider for CIE, we deliver both discussion-based tabletop exercises and dynamic live-play simulations, designed to rigorously test and enhance incident response capabilities. These exercises are crafted to reflect real-world attack scenarios, enabling organisations to evaluate their preparedness, identify vulnerabilities, and refine their response strategies in a controlled environment. By simulating incidents such as ransomware attacks or data breaches, CYSIAM ensures that both technical teams and executive leadership are equipped to act decisively during actual cyber crises. CYSIAM’s exercises are informed by current threat intelligence, ensuring relevance to the specific risks faced by your organisation. Post-exercise reviews provide actionable insights, facilitating the enhancement of incident response plans and contributing to a culture of continuous improvement. Benefits Improved Response Readiness: CIEs prepare teams to act swiftly and effectively during a real cyber incident by rehearsing roles, responsibilities, and decision-making under pressure. Identification of Gaps and Weaknesses: These exercises reveal shortcomings in existing policies, procedures, and technical controls, allowing organisations to address them before a real attack occurs. Enhanced Cross-Team Coordination: CIEs promote collaboration between IT, legal, communications, and executive teams, ensuring a unified and coherent response during a cyber crisis. Increased Stakeholder Confidence: Demonstrating preparedness through regular exercises reassures clients, regulators, and insurers that the organisation takes cyber resilience seriously.
