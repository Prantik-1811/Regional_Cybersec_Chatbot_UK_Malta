News Infosecurity Europe’s 2025 Cybersecurity Trends Report has revealed a significant shift in cybersecurity investment, with UK organisations predicting an average budget increase of 31% over the next 12 months. While this growth reflects a heightened awareness of cyber risks, the key question becomes: Where is the money going – and is it making a real difference? More Budget, More Security? Not Necessarily Throwing money at cybersecurity won’t automatically make an organisation safer. In fact, many businesses still fall victim to attacks despite major investments – often because funds are directed toward new tools while core fundamentals are overlooked. For example, recent breaches have stemmed not from a lack of tools, but from unpatched software, misconfigured systems , or human error – all of which can fly under the radar in a tech-heavy, strategy-light budget plan. The Foundations of a Smart Cyber Budget A well-rounded, resilient cybersecurity program should focus on three core pillars: 1. Technology – Investing in the Right Tools Yes, automation, threat detection, and endpoint security matter – but only when tools are properly configured, integrated, and supported. Avoid tool sprawl – too many platforms create complexity and blind spots. Prioritise value-add areas like zero-trust architectures and EDR/XDR . Invest in tools that match your risk profile , not just industry hype. 2. People – Strengthening Awareness & Talent Technology can’t stop a user from clicking a phishing link. That’s why investing in people is critical. Fund cyber awareness training , simulations, and behaviour change programs. Upskill internal teams and invest in attracting/retaining cybersecurity talent . Create a culture where cyber risk is owned across the business . 3. Processes – Building Security from the Ground Up Cyber hygiene isn’t glamorous, but it’s essential. Basics like patch management , access control , and MFA need budget attention. Test and refine your incident response and business continuity plans . Conduct regular tabletop exercises to improve reaction under pressure. Where Should You Focus in 2025? CISOs and tech leaders need to think beyond tools and take a holistic approach to spending. Here are five smart budget priorities for the year ahead: Top 5 Budget Priorities for 2025 Security Awareness Training – Still the best ROI in cybersecurity. Zero Trust Implementation – Reduce risk at every access point. Third-Party Risk Management – Secure your supply chain. Incident Response & Recovery – Be ready, not reactive. Tool Consolidation & Integration – Fewer platforms, greater clarity. Strategic Spending Starts with Risk Alignment To get the most out of growing budgets: Align with Business Risk – Focus on the threats that matter to your operations. Engage the Board – Translate cyber risk into business language. Track ROI – Make sure every investment contributes to measurable resilience. Looking Ahead: From Spending More to Spending Smarter With cyber threats evolving rapidly – and the growing influence of AI, insider risk, and regulatory pressure – the future of cyber resilience lies not in the size of your budget, but in how wisely it’s spent . Every pound should strengthen your organisation’s ability to detect, respond to, and recover from attacks. That means balancing tech with people and process – because a well-rounded approach isn’t optional, it’s essential. What do you think? Where should security leaders be focusing their spend in 2025? Get in touch to discuss your cybersecurity strategy.

CISOs and tech leaders need to think beyond tools and take a holistic approach to spending. Here are five smart budget priorities for the year ahead: Top 5 Budget Priorities for 2025 Security Awareness Training – Still the best ROI in cybersecurity. Zero Trust Implementation – Reduce risk at every access point. Third-Party Risk Management – Secure your supply chain. Incident Response & Recovery – Be ready, not reactive. Tool Consolidation & Integration – Fewer platforms, greater clarity. Strategic Spending Starts with Risk Alignment To get the most out of growing budgets: Align with Business Risk – Focus on the threats that matter to your operations. Engage the Board – Translate cyber risk into business language. Track ROI – Make sure every investment contributes to measurable resilience. Looking Ahead: From Spending More to Spending Smarter With cyber threats evolving rapidly – and the growing influence of AI, insider risk, and regulatory pressure – the future of cyber resilience lies not in the size of your budget, but in how wisely it’s spent . Every pound should strengthen your organisation’s ability to detect, respond to, and recover from attacks. That means balancing tech with people and process – because a well-rounded approach isn’t optional, it’s essential. What do you think? Where should security leaders be focusing their spend in 2025? Get in touch to discuss your cybersecurity strategy. Infosecurity Europe’s 2025 Cybersecurity Trends Report has revealed a significant shift in cybersecurity investment, with UK organisations predicting an average budget increase of 31% over the next 12 months. While this growth reflects a heightened awareness of cyber risks, the key question becomes: Where is the money going – and is it making a real difference? More Budget, More Security? Not Necessarily Throwing money at cybersecurity won’t automatically make an organisation safer. In fact, many businesses still fall victim to attacks despite major investments – often because funds are directed toward new tools while core fundamentals are overlooked. For example, recent breaches have stemmed not from a lack of tools, but from unpatched software, misconfigured systems , or human error – all of which can fly under the radar in a tech-heavy, strategy-light budget plan. The Foundations of a Smart Cyber Budget A well-rounded, resilient cybersecurity program should focus on three core pillars: 1. Technology – Investing in the Right Tools Yes, automation, threat detection, and endpoint security matter – but only when tools are properly configured, integrated, and supported. Avoid tool sprawl – too many platforms create complexity and blind spots. Prioritise value-add areas like zero-trust architectures and EDR/XDR . Invest in tools that match your risk profile , not just industry hype. 2. People – Strengthening Awareness & Talent Technology can’t stop a user from clicking a phishing link. That’s why investing in people is critical. Fund cyber awareness training , simulations, and behaviour change programs. Upskill internal teams and invest in attracting/retaining cybersecurity talent . Create a culture where cyber risk is owned across the business . 3. Processes – Building Security from the Ground Up Cyber hygiene isn’t glamorous, but it’s essential. Basics like patch management , access control , and MFA need budget attention. Test and refine your incident response and business continuity plans . Conduct regular tabletop exercises to improve reaction under pressure. Where Should You Focus in 2025?
