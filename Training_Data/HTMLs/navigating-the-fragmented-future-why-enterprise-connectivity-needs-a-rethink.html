For enterprises, the challenge is no longer just about being online, it's about being intelligently connected. As we look ahead, the future of enterprise connectivity will be defined by how well businesses adapt to an increasingly fragmented internet landscape, embrace decentralised cloud architectures and build resilience into every layer of their network strategy. Our latest Enterprise Horizons 2025 report of over 650 global technology leaders reveals a stark reality: 98% of enterprises say their network is a bottleneck to AI adoption. This figure underscores a critical truth: the network is no longer just infrastructure, it is a strategic asset. With this in mind, what are the insights and solutions enterprises can safeguard themselves with across an increasingly fragmented internet as they continue to shift away from traditional MPLS solutions? The move away from MPLS and the rise of scalable alternatives Traditional MPLS networks, once the gold standard for enterprise connectivity, are increasingly being replaced by more agile, scalable solutions. Our research shows that 43% of businesses are investing in future-ready networks, with many migrating away from MPLS and to the internet, often with SD-WAN and SASE architectures. This shift away from MPLS creates a new demand for enterprise networks, and that is one of internet resilience. Given the extent to which global enterprise operations are now connected via the internet, downtime is more costly than ever. Networks must be able to adapt in real time to disruptions, whether they're caused by cyber, geopolitical or any other 'everyday' events (damage to cables). The challenge companies are now facing is to navigate the fragmented internet in a way so that it performs similar to traditional MPLS network. This means having resilience, with network availability at 99.99% or more, together with full insights and a secure environment. The fragmented internet: a new normal The internet, by design, is a patchwork of independently operated networks – currently around 190,000. This is expected to rise to 230,000 over the next decade – because of this, there are plenty of variables to consider. While this decentralised model has enabled global scalability, it also introduces complexity and unpredictability. Data doesn't always take the safest or most efficient route, it takes the one dictated by BGP (Border Gateway Protocol). The key to BGP is to prioritise the shortest path, instead of taking the most secure or best performing route when routing data. This can expose sensitive enterprise data to jurisdictions or networks that pose compliance or security risks to data being routed via BGP. AI-powered solutions such as Enhanced Internet ensure consistency across cloud applications. Gaining global oversight of how networks are performing to effectively route data traffic via the best-performing network path is essential to safeguarding data routing on a global scale. Visibility, control and the role of external expertise As networks become more complex, the need for visibility and control becomes paramount. Enterprises must be able to see what's happening across their entire network, across regions, providers, and technologies, and act on that insight instantly. But visibility alone isn't enough. The skills required to design, implement, and manage these next-generation networks are in short supply. Rather than compete for a shrinking pool of networking talent, 45% of enterprises are turning to external partners for expertise. Embracing a decentralised cloud model In recent years we have seen applications, data, and users are no longer confined to a central office or data centre, they're everywhere and cloud models are becoming increasingly in demand as a result. This demands a new approach to connectivity, one that is cloud-native, edge-aware, and globally consistent. However, as geopolitical tensions continue to increase, enterprises located near these volatile geopolitical areas will need to assess their cloud environment to ensure data is located and routed exclusively through safe regions. Enterprises will soon need to architect their networks to support this decentralisation, ensuring that users have fast, secure access to applications no matter where they are. For data to remain secure, enterprises must carefully consider which regions are hosting data now more than ever before. The path forward So, even though in recent years we have seen an uptick in organisations moving towards a single cloud environment, rising geopolitical tensions and evolving regulations will bring new challenges for these enterprises. The decline of MPLS and the rise of scalable alternatives like SD-WAN and SASE reflect a broader shift towards cloud-native architectures. These technologies offer the agility and resilience needed to support distributed workforces and applications. Visibility is no longer optional. Businesses need real-time insight into their network performance and data routing to be able to make informed decisions and respond to threats quickly. Finally, with networking expertise in short supply, many organisations are turning to trusted partners that can help enterprises design and manage future-ready networks that are secure, scalable, and built for the demands of tomorrow. In a world where connectivity underpins every digital ambition, enterprises that invest in resilient, intelligent networks will be the ones that lead. The future of enterprise connectivity isn't just about staying online, it's about staying ahead.

This is expected to rise to 230,000 over the next decade – because of this, there are plenty of variables to consider. While this decentralised model has enabled global scalability, it also introduces complexity and unpredictability. Data doesn't always take the safest or most efficient route, it takes the one dictated by BGP (Border Gateway Protocol). The key to BGP is to prioritise the shortest path, instead of taking the most secure or best performing route when routing data. This can expose sensitive enterprise data to jurisdictions or networks that pose compliance or security risks to data being routed via BGP. AI-powered solutions such as Enhanced Internet ensure consistency across cloud applications. Gaining global oversight of how networks are performing to effectively route data traffic via the best-performing network path is essential to safeguarding data routing on a global scale. Visibility, control and the role of external expertise As networks become more complex, the need for visibility and control becomes paramount. Enterprises must be able to see what's happening across their entire network, across regions, providers, and technologies, and act on that insight instantly. But visibility alone isn't enough. The skills required to design, implement, and manage these next-generation networks are in short supply. Rather than compete for a shrinking pool of networking talent, 45% of enterprises are turning to external partners for expertise. Embracing a decentralised cloud model In recent years we have seen applications, data, and users are no longer confined to a central office or data centre, they're everywhere and cloud models are becoming increasingly in demand as a result. This demands a new approach to connectivity, one that is cloud-native, edge-aware, and globally consistent. However, as geopolitical tensions continue to increase, enterprises located near these volatile geopolitical areas will need to assess their cloud environment to ensure data is located and routed exclusively through safe regions. Enterprises will soon need to architect their networks to support this decentralisation, ensuring that users have fast, secure access to applications no matter where they are. For data to remain secure, enterprises must carefully consider which regions are hosting data now more than ever before. So, even though in recent years we have seen an uptick in organisations moving towards a single cloud environment, rising geopolitical tensions and evolving regulations will bring new challenges for these enterprises. The decline of MPLS and the rise of scalable alternatives like SD-WAN and SASE reflect a broader shift towards cloud-native architectures. These technologies offer the agility and resilience needed to support distributed workforces and applications. Visibility is no longer optional. Businesses need real-time insight into their network performance and data routing to be able to make informed decisions and respond to threats quickly. Finally, with networking expertise in short supply, many organisations are turning to trusted partners that can help enterprises design and manage future-ready networks that are secure, scalable, and built for the demands of tomorrow. In a world where connectivity underpins every digital ambition, enterprises that invest in resilient, intelligent networks will be the ones that lead. The future of enterprise connectivity isn't just about staying online, it's about staying ahead.
