This week has seen some important changes in news about UK cyber security conferences: I’m sorry to see that 44CON Cyber Security won’t be running this year, although I have no doubt the main 44CON event in September will be as excellent as always Great to see that DC44141 launched in Glasgow and was a very popular night – follow @ZephrFish for news of the next meet-up Impressed to read the submissions for BSides London this year – there’s some tough competition! I hope my talk gets through but, regardless, I’m really looking forward to the day.

This conference is unmissable in my book – an absolute favourite.
