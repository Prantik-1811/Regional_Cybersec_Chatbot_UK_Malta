Security Awareness Training Platform Tailored Employee Training That Makes a Difference Strengthen Your Security Culture and Reduce Risk with Targeted Awareness Training At CyberCrowd, we understand that the biggest threat to your business isn’t just external – it’s often within. Human error accounts for more than 80% of all cyber incidents, costing companies millions. The problem? Traditional training programs often fall short, failing to engage employees or inspire the right behaviours. That’s why we’ve introduced an advanced AI-powered security awareness training platform, designed to truly empower your employees. Our solution goes beyond just checking a box; it’s about creating a security-first culture that extends beyond the workplace and into your employees’ everyday lives. With AI-driven training and simulated phishing, organisations can effectively drive awareness and change user behaviour, reducing the risk of cyber threats. Why Our Training Stands Out Personalised Learning: Every employee gets customised security awareness and anti-phishing training tailored to their role and risk level. This ensures that the education is relevant, engaging, and most importantly, effective. Automated Delivery: Our platform automatically delivers training to those who need it most, keeping your team up to date with the latest threats without adding to your workload. Expert Guidance: With a dedicated training manager working alongside your internal team, we design, distribute, and track the progress of a tailored training program that meets your specific needs. Comprehensive Resources: With over 2,000 learning materials at our disposal, we can create anything from a fully embedded 12-month training program to a quick, targeted campaign that responds to the ever-changing cybersecurity landscape. The Benefits for Your Business By investing in this state-of-the-art training, you’re not just protecting your business – you’re building a more resilient, informed, and proactive workforce. This translates into fewer security breaches, lower recovery costs, and a stronger reputation with your clients and partners.
