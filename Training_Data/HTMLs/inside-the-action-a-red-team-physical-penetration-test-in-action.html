Pen Testing “Good morning!” A friendly smile and a casual wave were all it took for a CyberCrowd tester to tailgate into the restricted area of a corporate headquarters. Moments earlier, a second tester had breezed past the front desk with a convincing excuse for the receptionist. What followed was a strategic demonstration of Red Team tactics, uncovering vulnerabilities even the most prepared organisations can overlook. What is Red Teaming? Red Teaming is the ultimate test of an organisation’s defences, simulating a determined adversary’s attack. Combining technical precision, social engineering, and real-world tactics, CyberCrowd’s Red Team engagements go beyond compliance checklists to provide a comprehensive assessment of physical, digital, and human security. The Art of Knowing Your Target Before stepping on-site, preparation is key. Each engagement begins with meticulous Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering. Using tools like Google Maps, LinkedIn, and social media, CyberCrowd’s team pieces together a detailed picture of the target organisation. This reconnaissance provides insights into: Office layouts and external access points. Employee routines and workwear. Sensitive details inadvertently revealed in online posts. This preparation not only sharpens the strategy but also highlights how minor oversights can create significant vulnerabilities. (For more on this process, see our blog: Behind the Scenes of a Red Team Operation .) Day 1: Setting the Stage The engagement began with a vishing phone call, establishing a credible cover story for the tester. Armed with this pretext, they arrived on-site ready to observe and strategise. The first tester greeted the receptionist with the fabricated excuse set up during the vishing call – making the receptionist effectively expect them, albeit for a made-up reason – and walked straight through the front door. Meanwhile, the second tester relied on tailgating, politely following an employee who held the door open with a friendly “good morning.” Both entered the building without resistance, underscoring how social norms and staff politeness can create exploitable gaps. Inside, the team conducted light reconnaissance, discreetly observing daily operations and identifying potential targets such as communication rooms and network hubs. At one point, an IT staff member unwittingly assisted a tester by entering a password into their laptop, assuming the tester was a new contractor. This moment revealed a significant lapse in protocol adherence and staff training. Day 2: Escalating the Engagement Armed with intelligence gathered on Day 1, the team escalated their activities. Using hardware tools such as key loggers, Dropbox’s and Ethernet connections, they gained network access. A lack of segmentation allowed them to move laterally within the network, uncovering critical vulnerabilities. While one tester was eventually caught due to their lack of sign-in credentials, the other continued undetected, connecting to sensitive systems and performing network scans and attacks. These actions highlighted gaps in monitoring and incident response. Leaving the Building After compromising the network, the tester completed their engagement with precision and stealth. Carefully dismantling their equipment and ensuring no trace of their activities remained, they seamlessly blended into the daily flow of employees, walking out unnoticed. Their exit was as unremarkable as their entry – proof of how easily determined adversaries can exploit overlooked vulnerabilities. The insights gained during the operation would now serve as a roadmap for strengthening the organisation’s defences. Key Vulnerabilities Identified This engagement exposed several common security weaknesses: Tailgating: Employees unwittingly allowing access due to social norms. Social Engineering: Staff providing assistance without verifying identity. Insufficient Network Segmentation: Allowing unrestricted lateral movement. Unsecured Communication Rooms: Easy physical access to sensitive areas. Lessons Learned The exercise demonstrated that even well-established organisations are vulnerable when human factors and insufficient training come into play. Addressing these risks requires a multi-layered approach: Educating employees on social engineering and tailgating risks. Enforcing strict ID and access policies. Implementing robust network segmentation and monitoring. Securing sensitive physical areas like communication cabinets.

Moments earlier, a second tester had breezed past the front desk with a convincing excuse for the receptionist. What followed was a strategic demonstration of Red Team tactics, uncovering vulnerabilities even the most prepared organisations can overlook. What is Red Teaming? Red Teaming is the ultimate test of an organisation’s defences, simulating a determined adversary’s attack. Combining technical precision, social engineering, and real-world tactics, CyberCrowd’s Red Team engagements go beyond compliance checklists to provide a comprehensive assessment of physical, digital, and human security. The Art of Knowing Your Target Before stepping on-site, preparation is key. Each engagement begins with meticulous Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering. Using tools like Google Maps, LinkedIn, and social media, CyberCrowd’s team pieces together a detailed picture of the target organisation. This reconnaissance provides insights into: Office layouts and external access points. Employee routines and workwear. Sensitive details inadvertently revealed in online posts. This preparation not only sharpens the strategy but also highlights how minor oversights can create significant vulnerabilities. (For more on this process, see our blog: Behind the Scenes of a Red Team Operation .) Day 1: Setting the Stage The engagement began with a vishing phone call, establishing a credible cover story for the tester. Armed with this pretext, they arrived on-site ready to observe and strategise. The first tester greeted the receptionist with the fabricated excuse set up during the vishing call – making the receptionist effectively expect them, albeit for a made-up reason – and walked straight through the front door. Meanwhile, the second tester relied on tailgating, politely following an employee who held the door open with a friendly “good morning.” Both entered the building without resistance, underscoring how social norms and staff politeness can create exploitable gaps. Inside, the team conducted light reconnaissance, discreetly observing daily operations and identifying potential targets such as communication rooms and network hubs. At one point, an IT staff member unwittingly assisted a tester by entering a password into their laptop, assuming the tester was a new contractor. This moment revealed a significant lapse in protocol adherence and staff training. Day 2: Escalating the Engagement Armed with intelligence gathered on Day 1, the team escalated their activities. Using hardware tools such as key loggers, Dropbox’s and Ethernet connections, they gained network access. A lack of segmentation allowed them to move laterally within the network, uncovering critical vulnerabilities. While one tester was eventually caught due to their lack of sign-in credentials, the other continued undetected, connecting to sensitive systems and performing network scans and attacks. These actions highlighted gaps in monitoring and incident response. Leaving the Building After compromising the network, the tester completed their engagement with precision and stealth. Carefully dismantling their equipment and ensuring no trace of their activities remained, they seamlessly blended into the daily flow of employees, walking out unnoticed. Their exit was as unremarkable as their entry – proof of how easily determined adversaries can exploit overlooked vulnerabilities. The insights gained during the operation would now serve as a roadmap for strengthening the organisation’s defences. Key Vulnerabilities Identified This engagement exposed several common security weaknesses: Tailgating: Employees unwittingly allowing access due to social norms. Social Engineering: Staff providing assistance without verifying identity. Insufficient Network Segmentation: Allowing unrestricted lateral movement. Unsecured Communication Rooms: Easy physical access to sensitive areas. Lessons Learned The exercise demonstrated that even well-established organisations are vulnerable when human factors and insufficient training come into play. Addressing these risks requires a multi-layered approach: Educating employees on social engineering and tailgating risks. Enforcing strict ID and access policies. Implementing robust network segmentation and monitoring. Securing sensitive physical areas like communication cabinets. CyberCrowd’s Comprehensive Approach At CyberCrowd, we blend physical, digital, and human factors into every security assessment. Our CREST-accredited experts don’t just identify vulnerabilities – we provide actionable recommendations to help organisations build robust defences.

Related Article: READ NOW: Behind the Scenes of a Red Team Operation: Exposing Your Security Gaps A Word from Our Head of Pen Testing “Good morning!” A friendly smile and a casual wave were all it took for a CyberCrowd tester to tailgate into the restricted area of a corporate headquarters. Moments earlier, a second tester had breezed past the front desk with a convincing excuse for the receptionist. What followed was a strategic demonstration of Red Team tactics, uncovering vulnerabilities even the most prepared organisations can overlook. What is Red Teaming? Red Teaming is the ultimate test of an organisation’s defences, simulating a determined adversary’s attack. Combining technical precision, social engineering, and real-world tactics, CyberCrowd’s Red Team engagements go beyond compliance checklists to provide a comprehensive assessment of physical, digital, and human security. The Art of Knowing Your Target Before stepping on-site, preparation is key. Each engagement begins with meticulous Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering. Using tools like Google Maps, LinkedIn, and social media, CyberCrowd’s team pieces together a detailed picture of the target organisation. This reconnaissance provides insights into: Office layouts and external access points. Employee routines and workwear. Sensitive details inadvertently revealed in online posts. This preparation not only sharpens the strategy but also highlights how minor oversights can create significant vulnerabilities. (For more on this process, see our blog: Behind the Scenes of a Red Team Operation .) Day 1: Setting the Stage The engagement began with a vishing phone call, establishing a credible cover story for the tester. Armed with this pretext, they arrived on-site ready to observe and strategise. The first tester greeted the receptionist with the fabricated excuse set up during the vishing call – making the receptionist effectively expect them, albeit for a made-up reason – and walked straight through the front door. Meanwhile, the second tester relied on tailgating, politely following an employee who held the door open with a friendly “good morning.” Both entered the building without resistance, underscoring how social norms and staff politeness can create exploitable gaps. Inside, the team conducted light reconnaissance, discreetly observing daily operations and identifying potential targets such as communication rooms and network hubs. At one point, an IT staff member unwittingly assisted a tester by entering a password into their laptop, assuming the tester was a new contractor. This moment revealed a significant lapse in protocol adherence and staff training. Day 2: Escalating the Engagement Armed with intelligence gathered on Day 1, the team escalated their activities. Using hardware tools such as key loggers, Dropbox’s and Ethernet connections, they gained network access. A lack of segmentation allowed them to move laterally within the network, uncovering critical vulnerabilities. While one tester was eventually caught due to their lack of sign-in credentials, the other continued undetected, connecting to sensitive systems and performing network scans and attacks. These actions highlighted gaps in monitoring and incident response. Leaving the Building After compromising the network, the tester completed their engagement with precision and stealth. Carefully dismantling their equipment and ensuring no trace of their activities remained, they seamlessly blended into the daily flow of employees, walking out unnoticed. Their exit was as unremarkable as their entry – proof of how easily determined adversaries can exploit overlooked vulnerabilities. The insights gained during the operation would now serve as a roadmap for strengthening the organisation’s defences. Key Vulnerabilities Identified This engagement exposed several common security weaknesses: Tailgating: Employees unwittingly allowing access due to social norms. Social Engineering: Staff providing assistance without verifying identity. Insufficient Network Segmentation: Allowing unrestricted lateral movement. Unsecured Communication Rooms: Easy physical access to sensitive areas. Lessons Learned The exercise demonstrated that even well-established organisations are vulnerable when human factors and insufficient training come into play. Addressing these risks requires a multi-layered approach: Educating employees on social engineering and tailgating risks. Enforcing strict ID and access policies. Implementing robust network segmentation and monitoring. Securing sensitive physical areas like communication cabinets.
