News From high street staples to luxury brands and emerging e-commerce platforms, no retailer is too big – or too small – to be a target. A recent wave of cyberattacks across the UK retail sector highlights a troubling and urgent reality: attackers are becoming bolder, faster, and far more disruptive – and retail remains firmly in their sights. In 2025 alone, M&S, Co-op, and Cartier have all confirmed significant cyber breaches – each highlighting different vulnerabilities and attack vectors. While these household names draw headlines, the lesson is clear for every retailer: if you hold valuable data, manage a digital supply chain, or sell online, you’re a target. The 2025 Cyber Attacks Rocking Retail Let’s look at just a few of the most recent, high-profile incidents and what we can learn from them: Marks & Spencer (M&S) – April 2025 M&S was targeted by the ransomware group Scattered Spider over the Easter weekend. The attack disrupted e-commerce systems, exposed customer data, and is estimated to cost the company up to £300 million in lost profits and recovery costs. The attackers reportedly gained access via a third-party provider , illustrating the risk posed by loosely managed vendor relationships. Co-op – May 2025 Co-op experienced a major system outage following a suspected supply chain attack , resulting in shelves left empty , payment issues across its stores, and unauthorised access to data linked to current and former members . Attackers exploited shared access points within logistics and IT systems – a common weakness in integrated retail networks. Cartier – June 2025 Luxury retailer Cartier was hit by a breach involving unauthorised access to client records including names, contact details, and locations . Although financial data wasn’t exposed, the risk of targeted phishing is now elevated. This type of attack, while quieter, is designed for data harvesting and resale , often part of broader campaigns targeting affluent customers. Who’s Behind the Attacks? Several advanced threat groups are targeting retailers right now. Here’s who they are and how they operate: Scattered Spider (aka UNC3944) Highly active in 2024–25, known for targeting cloud environments and identity platforms like Okta and Azure AD. Uses phishing, SIM-swapping, and MFA fatigue attacks to bypass defences. Focused on disruption and extortion , with reported links to BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware operations. DragonForce Malaysia Hacktivist-style group targeting Western companies with data leaks and reputational attacks . Often driven by geopolitical or ideological motives, but with professional execution. C10p & LockBit Two of the most prolific ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) gangs. Known for exploiting zero-days (e.g., MOVEit, GoAnywhere) to infiltrate large organisations. Combine data exfiltration with encryption , increasing pressure to pay. Why Retail is So Vulnerable Retailers are a prime target for multiple reasons: High-value customer data (personal, payment, loyalty data) Digital sprawl (POS, e-commerce, logistics, CRM, loyalty systems) Complex supply chains with lots of third-party access points Mixed infrastructure – legacy tech meets cloud-first systems Time-sensitive operations – especially around key seasons For attackers, this means multiple ways in , and high pressure for victims to pay quickly when disrupted. It’s Not Just the Big Brands at Risk While the headlines focus on household names, mid-sized and independent retailers are increasingly being targeted too – often because attackers know they’re less likely to have mature defences . Many SMB retailers: Assume their size makes them “under the radar” Don’t regularly test their systems or cloud environments Rely on outsourced IT providers and assume security is “handled” Unfortunately, this false sense of security creates easy opportunities for cybercriminals. A Quick Step Guide for Retailers Concerned About Cyber Security Whether you’re running a chain of 300 stores or an online business with 3 employees – here’s where to start: 1. Understand Your Attack Surface Audit what’s publicly exposed – including legacy sites, APIs, and forgotten admin panels. 2. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Everywhere This simple step blocks a huge percentage of attacks. 3. Get a Penetration Test A focused test can identify vulnerabilities before attackers do – especially in: Web applications Cloud configs (M365, Azure, AWS, GCP) Supply chain integrations Payment platforms 4. Review Your Cloud Configurations Many breaches occur not through hacking, but through misconfiguration : Over-permissive accounts in Microsoft 365 Unsecured AWS buckets Weak role-based access in Azure Admin portals exposed without MFA 5. Prepare for the Worst Develop and rehearse an incident response plan . Know who you’ll call, how you’ll respond, and what regulators/customers need to hear. 6. Certify with Cyber Essentials This UK government-backed scheme helps you: Prove basic cyber hygiene Win trust from customers and suppliers Meet requirements for many public-sector contracts How We Can Help We work with retail brands across the UK – from family-owned businesses to national names – helping them get a handle on cyber security without overwhelming them.

Final Thought Retailers don’t just need to sell safely – they need to operate securely , protect their customers, and guard their reputation in a highly connected world. The threats are real; the stakes are high – but the solutions don’t have to be complicated.

Many SMB retailers: Assume their size makes them “under the radar” Don’t regularly test their systems or cloud environments Rely on outsourced IT providers and assume security is “handled” Unfortunately, this false sense of security creates easy opportunities for cybercriminals.

A recent wave of cyberattacks across the UK retail sector highlights a troubling and urgent reality: attackers are becoming bolder, faster, and far more disruptive – and retail remains firmly in their sights. In 2025 alone, M&S, Co-op, and Cartier have all confirmed significant cyber breaches – each highlighting different vulnerabilities and attack vectors. While these household names draw headlines, the lesson is clear for every retailer: if you hold valuable data, manage a digital supply chain, or sell online, you’re a target. The 2025 Cyber Attacks Rocking Retail Let’s look at just a few of the most recent, high-profile incidents and what we can learn from them: Marks & Spencer (M&S) – April 2025 M&S was targeted by the ransomware group Scattered Spider over the Easter weekend. The attack disrupted e-commerce systems, exposed customer data, and is estimated to cost the company up to £300 million in lost profits and recovery costs. The attackers reportedly gained access via a third-party provider , illustrating the risk posed by loosely managed vendor relationships. Co-op – May 2025 Co-op experienced a major system outage following a suspected supply chain attack , resulting in shelves left empty , payment issues across its stores, and unauthorised access to data linked to current and former members . Attackers exploited shared access points within logistics and IT systems – a common weakness in integrated retail networks. Cartier – June 2025 Luxury retailer Cartier was hit by a breach involving unauthorised access to client records including names, contact details, and locations . Although financial data wasn’t exposed, the risk of targeted phishing is now elevated. This type of attack, while quieter, is designed for data harvesting and resale , often part of broader campaigns targeting affluent customers. Who’s Behind the Attacks? Several advanced threat groups are targeting retailers right now. Here’s who they are and how they operate: Scattered Spider (aka UNC3944) Highly active in 2024–25, known for targeting cloud environments and identity platforms like Okta and Azure AD. Uses phishing, SIM-swapping, and MFA fatigue attacks to bypass defences. Focused on disruption and extortion , with reported links to BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware operations. DragonForce Malaysia Hacktivist-style group targeting Western companies with data leaks and reputational attacks . Often driven by geopolitical or ideological motives, but with professional execution. C10p & LockBit Two of the most prolific ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) gangs. Known for exploiting zero-days (e.g., MOVEit, GoAnywhere) to infiltrate large organisations. Combine data exfiltration with encryption , increasing pressure to pay.
