News When a cyber incident strikes, response time and expertise matter. That’s why CyberCrowd is proud to be one of a select number of UK organisations recognised by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) with Cyber Incident Response (CIR) Level 2 Provider Status . This prestigious certification positions us among a small group of trusted incident response providers who have met the NCSC’s exacting standards – and it reflects our deep expertise in managing and mitigating cyber threats for both public and private sector organisations. Why does this matter? Achieving CIR Level 2 Provider Status isn’t just a milestone for CyberCrowd – it’s a powerful reassurance to our clients. It means: We have been independently assessed and approved by the NCSC for our ability to support organisations through complex cyber incidents. We meet national-level criteria for detection, containment, forensic analysis, and recovery. Our incident response team operates with the highest level of technical and procedural rigour. As cyber threats grow more sophisticated, working with a verified and capable response provider is essential. Whether it’s a ransomware attack, supply chain breach, or data compromise, CyberCrowd delivers rapid and reliable support. Supporting your resilience At the heart of our incident response capability is our UK-based Security Operations Centre (SOC) , running 24/7/365.

If you want to strengthen your cyber response plans or have concerns about your current preparedness, get in touch today. We’re here to help. When a cyber incident strikes, response time and expertise matter. That’s why CyberCrowd is proud to be one of a select number of UK organisations recognised by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) with Cyber Incident Response (CIR) Level 2 Provider Status . This prestigious certification positions us among a small group of trusted incident response providers who have met the NCSC’s exacting standards – and it reflects our deep expertise in managing and mitigating cyber threats for both public and private sector organisations. Why does this matter? Achieving CIR Level 2 Provider Status isn’t just a milestone for CyberCrowd – it’s a powerful reassurance to our clients. It means: We have been independently assessed and approved by the NCSC for our ability to support organisations through complex cyber incidents. We meet national-level criteria for detection, containment, forensic analysis, and recovery. Our incident response team operates with the highest level of technical and procedural rigour. As cyber threats grow more sophisticated, working with a verified and capable response provider is essential. Whether it’s a ransomware attack, supply chain breach, or data compromise, CyberCrowd delivers rapid and reliable support. Supporting your resilience At the heart of our incident response capability is our UK-based Security Operations Centre (SOC) , running 24/7/365. Our Managed Detection and Response (MDR) services combine real-time monitoring, threat intelligence, and expert analysis to detect and respond to threats – fast. We also offer tailored services that go beyond the immediate crisis. From post-incident reviews to ongoing strategy development, we help organisations build long-term cyber resilience. What is NCSC CIR Level 2? The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), part of GCHQ, created the CIR Assured Service Provider scheme to ensure high standards in incident response services. Level 2 providers like CyberCrowd are authorised to assist a broad range of organisations, including local authorities, charities, and businesses – providing reassurance that expert help is available even in high-stakes situations. More Than Just Incident Response In addition to our NCSC Assured status for Cyber Incident Response (Level 2), CyberCrowd is also recognised by the National Cyber Security Centre as an Assured Service Provider for Cyber Incident Exercising and Cyber Advisor (Cyber Essentials) . Cyber Incident Exercising: We help organisations rehearse their response to cyber incidents through realistic, NCSC-recognised tabletop and technical exercises. These sessions ensure your team is prepared, aligned, and able to act decisively under pressure. Find out more HERE . Cyber Advisor (Cyber Essentials): As an NCSC Cyber Advisor, we guide organisations through the Cyber Essentials framework, supporting them in strengthening their foundational security controls and achieving certification. Find out more HERE . These additional accreditations reinforce our commitment to helping organisations build resilience at every level – from preparation and prevention to response and recovery. Expertise that works for you CyberCrowd’s CIR Level 2 status is your assurance that our team is prepared, capable, and certified to support you when it matters most. It complements our full suite of cybersecurity services – from prevention to response – and supports our mission to keep UK organisations safe.
