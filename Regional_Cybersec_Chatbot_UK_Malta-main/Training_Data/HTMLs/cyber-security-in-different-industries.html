Home / Careers in Cyber Security / Cyber Security in Different... The need for good cyber security is applicable to everyone, spanning all organisations and industries. Even where it may not be expected, reliance on cyber security is integral to the smooth and efficient running of every type of business. There is certainly an understanding of the need for good cyber security within high-profile industries such as the entertainment and journalism sectors. Within entertainment and journalism is a need to keep exclusive information under wraps. Unreleased songs must be kept secret, while groundbreaking interviews must not be leaked in order to retain integrity. This is exemplified in the Vanity Fair interview with Caitlyn Jenner after her transition. The exclusivity of this interview meant that every security measure was taken to ensure that the information was kept secure- Nobody on the site of the shoot was allowed their mobile phones, to ensure no pictures were taken, the finished article was kept on just one computer which had never been connected to the internet, and the data from the interview was stored on a flash drive overnight and deleted from the computer. When the article was complete, it was hand-delivered to the printers, so as not to add the risks associated with it being sent via the internet. Celebrities and influencers alike have to take cyber security extremely seriously, as their large following, wealth and status makes them prime targets for attack. Where money or information is available, cyber criminals will look to take advantage of this, seen in scams directed at Instagram influencers, such as those which involve hackers attacking accounts, changing passwords and then demanding a high ransom fee to get the account back. Celebrities, politicians and well-known brands have had their Twitter accounts hacked, spreading false information or posting scams to get followers to send money or provide sensitive information. Sectors without such a glamorous appeal are just as susceptible to attack. Many small businesses, for example, may not consider themselves at risk of cyber attack. This idea fails to recognise that many attacks are untargeted, and that the information and finances of many small businesses are desirable to cyber criminals. The Federation of Small Businesses has found that 20% of small businesses in the UK have suffered a cyber attack, highlighting the importance of cyber security to each and every company. Other, seemingly inconspicuous sectors, such as education, are often victims of cyber attack. With organisations like schools, colleges and universities storing and accessing large amounts of data, these kinds of places are very attractive to cyber criminals. Again, where information, access, money or assets are available, cyber attacks are not unlikely. Even where information or assets are lacking, industries or organisations can still fall victim to untargeted attacks or can be affected as collateral damage of another attack.
