News Imagine this: your team is locked in a high-stakes cyber crisis. The clock is ticking. A breach has occurred, and you must work together to uncover the insider threat before it’s too late. This isn’t a scene from the latest thriller – it’s Cyber Escape – The Insider , CyberCrowd’s immersive Cyber Escape Room training experience . Designed for both technical and non-technical teams , this high-energy, hands-on challenge tests your cyber awareness, problem-solving skills, and teamwork under pressure. What Is The Insider? The Insider is not your typical cyber security training. Instead of static presentations and long-winded lectures, this experience throws you right into the action . You and your team will work together to: Identify and track down the insider threat Solve puzzles, crack codes, and uncover clues Make critical security decisions under pressure Escape before time runs out This game-based learning approach transforms cyber security training into an engaging, memorable, and fun experience that strengthens team collaboration while reinforcing real-world cyber security best practices . Why Escape Room Training? Traditional cybersecurity awareness training is valuable, but it can sometimes struggle to fully engage employees in a way that ensures long-term retention. That’s where The Insider stands out – it transforms learning into an interactive, hands-on experience that makes security principles memorable and actionable. Engages all learning styles – Hands-on, visual, auditory, and problem-solving elements create a deeper understanding. Encourages teamwork – Cyber security isn’t a solo effort; success depends on collaboration. Makes learning stick – Participants actively engage with security concepts in a way they’ll remember long after the session ends. Suitable for all levels – Whether you’re in IT, HR, Finance, or Marketing, everyone has a role to play in protecting the business. Safe environment for failure – Learn from mistakes in a risk-free, supportive setting. What Participants Are Saying “Just wanted to drop a quick email to say thank you for providing the training. It went down really well. Everyone loved it. It really was excellent on so many levels. The team building, the accessibility of it, the content was spot on. Just marvellous. The CyberCrowd team were so good. Loved it. We definitely want to run a bigger staff one as soon as we have the big group from the regions in.” — Maggie Bremner, NASUWT, The Teachers’ Union Get Your Team Together & Start Your Escape Cyber threats are real, constant, and evolving – but security awareness doesn’t have to be dull. The Insider ensures your team learns how to recognise threats, think critically, and act fast in the face of a security breach. Are you ready to take on the challenge?
