Managed Detection & Response News Ransomware continues to dominate headlines as one of the most damaging cyber threats facing organisations today. It’s no longer just an IT issue – it has real-world consequences for businesses, customers, and even national security. With cybercriminals becoming more sophisticated, organisations must be proactive in their defence. But what exactly is ransomware, how does it work, and – if the worst happens – should you pay the ransom? What Is Ransomware? Ransomware is a form of malicious software designed to encrypt files or lock users out of their systems until a ransom is paid. It typically spreads through phishing emails, compromised websites, or vulnerabilities in software. Once inside a system, ransomware can move laterally across networks, encrypting critical data and disrupting operations. Cybercriminals don’t just demand money; they increasingly use double extortion tactics – not only encrypting data but also threatening to leak stolen information if the ransom isn’t paid. The impact can be catastrophic, leading to financial losses, reputational damage, regulatory fines, and operational downtime. How Does Ransomware Work? Most ransomware attacks follow a structured process: Infection – Attackers gain initial access, often through phishing emails, malicious links, or unpatched software vulnerabilities. Execution – The malware executes, encrypting files and spreading across the network. Ransom Note – A demand for payment appears, often in cryptocurrency, with threats of data loss or publication. Extortion & Escalation – If the ransom isn’t paid, attackers may increase their threats, leak data, or disrupt business operations further. Ransomware groups are well-organised, often operating as Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) , where attackers lease malware from developers in exchange for a cut of the ransom payments. Should You Pay the Ransom? This is the question no organisation wants to face. Paying the ransom does not guarantee the safe return of your data. It may also encourage further attacks and, in some cases, violate laws related to financing criminal organisations. In the UK, authorities strongly discourage ransom payments. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and law enforcement agencies advise against paying, as it fuels the ransomware economy. Some threat actors, such as LockBit , have even been sanctioned by the UK government due to their involvement in crippling ransomware attacks against critical services. Instead of relying on ransom payments, businesses must focus on prevention, detection, and response . Prevent & Protect: Building a Strong Defence Prevention is always better than recovery. Organisations should: Educate Employees – Phishing remains the primary attack vector. Regular security training helps staff recognise malicious emails and links. Apply Security Patching – Keeping software and systems updated reduces vulnerabilities that attackers exploit. Implement Zero Trust – Limit user access to only what is necessary, reducing the risk of attackers gaining full system control. Back Up Data – Regular, secure, and offline backups ensure that encrypted files can be restored without paying a ransom. Deploy Endpoint Protection – Advanced security tools can detect and block ransomware before it executes. Monitor & Detect: Identifying Threats in Real Time Even the best defences can be breached. Organisations must have robust monitoring in place to detect ransomware activity before it spreads: 24/7 Threat Monitoring – A Security Operations Centre (SOC) continuously analyses network activity for signs of ransomware. Behavioural Analysis – AI-driven detection tools spot suspicious file encryption and lateral movement. Incident Response Planning – A well-tested plan ensures teams know exactly how to act in the event of an attack. Respond & Recover: Minimising Damage and Restoring Operations When ransomware strikes, a swift and coordinated response is critical: Isolate Affected Systems – Disconnect infected machines to prevent further spread. Engage Cybersecurity Experts – Immediate forensic analysis helps contain and remediate the attack. Notify Authorities – Report incidents to the NCSC and law enforcement to support wider threat intelligence efforts. Restore from Backups – If properly maintained, offline backups can restore operations without engaging with attackers. The NCSC’s Ransomware Guidance The NCSC provides essential guidance for organisations of all sizes, outlining best practices for prevention, response, and recovery.

It’s no longer just an IT issue – it has real-world consequences for businesses, customers, and even national security. With cybercriminals becoming more sophisticated, organisations must be proactive in their defence. But what exactly is ransomware, how does it work, and – if the worst happens – should you pay the ransom? What Is Ransomware? Ransomware is a form of malicious software designed to encrypt files or lock users out of their systems until a ransom is paid. It typically spreads through phishing emails, compromised websites, or vulnerabilities in software. Once inside a system, ransomware can move laterally across networks, encrypting critical data and disrupting operations. Cybercriminals don’t just demand money; they increasingly use double extortion tactics – not only encrypting data but also threatening to leak stolen information if the ransom isn’t paid. The impact can be catastrophic, leading to financial losses, reputational damage, regulatory fines, and operational downtime. How Does Ransomware Work? Most ransomware attacks follow a structured process: Infection – Attackers gain initial access, often through phishing emails, malicious links, or unpatched software vulnerabilities. Execution – The malware executes, encrypting files and spreading across the network. Ransom Note – A demand for payment appears, often in cryptocurrency, with threats of data loss or publication. Extortion & Escalation – If the ransom isn’t paid, attackers may increase their threats, leak data, or disrupt business operations further. Ransomware groups are well-organised, often operating as Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) , where attackers lease malware from developers in exchange for a cut of the ransom payments. Should You Pay the Ransom? This is the question no organisation wants to face. Paying the ransom does not guarantee the safe return of your data. It may also encourage further attacks and, in some cases, violate laws related to financing criminal organisations. In the UK, authorities strongly discourage ransom payments. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and law enforcement agencies advise against paying, as it fuels the ransomware economy. Some threat actors, such as LockBit , have even been sanctioned by the UK government due to their involvement in crippling ransomware attacks against critical services. Instead of relying on ransom payments, businesses must focus on prevention, detection, and response . Prevent & Protect: Building a Strong Defence Prevention is always better than recovery. Organisations should: Educate Employees – Phishing remains the primary attack vector. Regular security training helps staff recognise malicious emails and links. Apply Security Patching – Keeping software and systems updated reduces vulnerabilities that attackers exploit. Implement Zero Trust – Limit user access to only what is necessary, reducing the risk of attackers gaining full system control. Back Up Data – Regular, secure, and offline backups ensure that encrypted files can be restored without paying a ransom. Deploy Endpoint Protection – Advanced security tools can detect and block ransomware before it executes. Monitor & Detect: Identifying Threats in Real Time Even the best defences can be breached. Organisations must have robust monitoring in place to detect ransomware activity before it spreads: 24/7 Threat Monitoring – A Security Operations Centre (SOC) continuously analyses network activity for signs of ransomware. Behavioural Analysis – AI-driven detection tools spot suspicious file encryption and lateral movement. Incident Response Planning – A well-tested plan ensures teams know exactly how to act in the event of an attack. Respond & Recover: Minimising Damage and Restoring Operations When ransomware strikes, a swift and coordinated response is critical: Isolate Affected Systems – Disconnect infected machines to prevent further spread. Engage Cybersecurity Experts – Immediate forensic analysis helps contain and remediate the attack. Notify Authorities – Report incidents to the NCSC and law enforcement to support wider threat intelligence efforts. Restore from Backups – If properly maintained, offline backups can restore operations without engaging with attackers. The NCSC’s Ransomware Guidance The NCSC provides essential guidance for organisations of all sizes, outlining best practices for prevention, response, and recovery.
