If a compromise is identified during a Reliance Cyber assessment, our cybersecurity experts swiftly collaborate with your team to contain the breach, mitigate its impact, and eliminate the threat.

The frequency of compromise assessments depends on several factors, including your organisation’s risk profile, industry regulations, and the pace of change in your IT environment.

What are compromise assessments and indicators of compromise Compromise assessments are thorough evaluations conducted by cybersecurity professionals to detect any signs of security breaches or compromises within an organisation’s systems and networks. These assessments focus on identifying Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), which are specific pieces of evidence that suggest a system has been, or may soon be, compromised. IOCs can include unusual network traffic, unexpected system behaviour, unauthorised access logs, and the presence of known malware signatures. How regularly should a company do compromise assessments? As highlighted, a comprehensive compromise assessment should be performed at least annually. Depending on your organisation’s specific risk factors and any recent changes or events, more frequent, targeted assessments might be appropriate.

MORE INFORMATION Why IOC security is important Understanding Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) is crucial for protecting your network. IOCs act as digital footprints of malicious activity, and detecting them early can prevent serious damage. As cyber threats grow more sophisticated, robust IOC security becomes essential to avoid prolonged breaches. Early detection through IOCs enables quick response, limiting the impact of threats. Investing in IOC security ensures your business stays one step ahead of cyber threats, providing a proactive defence that’s vital for protecting your digital assets.

If a compromise is identified during a Reliance Cyber assessment, our cybersecurity experts swiftly collaborate with your team to contain the breach, mitigate its impact, and eliminate the threat. This process typically includes navigating the incident response cycle of identify contain eradicate and recover – we do this by isolating the compromised systems, eradicating malware, resetting credentials, and performing a thorough forensic analysis to understand the breach’s scope and root cause. We also provide detailed guidance on remediation and help you implement measures to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future. How often should businesses perform compromise assessments? The frequency of compromise assessments depends on several factors, including your organisation’s risk profile, industry regulations, and the pace of change in your IT environment. Generally, Reliance Cyber recommends conducting a comprehensive compromise assessment at least once a year. However, for high-risk systems or following specific events—such as a suspected breach,the deployment of new technology or acquisition of a company—more frequent, targeted assessments may be necessary. What are compromise assessments and indicators of compromise Compromise assessments are thorough evaluations conducted by cybersecurity professionals to detect any signs of security breaches or compromises within an organisation’s systems and networks. These assessments focus on identifying Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), which are specific pieces of evidence that suggest a system has been, or may soon be, compromised. IOCs can include unusual network traffic, unexpected system behaviour, unauthorised access logs, and the presence of known malware signatures. How regularly should a company do compromise assessments? As highlighted, a comprehensive compromise assessment should be performed at least annually. Depending on your organisation’s specific risk factors and any recent changes or events, more frequent, targeted assessments might be appropriate. Reliance Cyber works closely with organisations to develop a customised assessment schedule that fits their unique security needs and helps maintain a strong defence posture. Can compromise assessments help with compliance requirements? Yes, compromise assessments play a critical role in helping organisations meet various compliance requirements. By detecting potential breaches and ensuring the integrity of your systems, these assessments demonstrate due diligence and support adherence to industry regulations like GDPR, PCI-DSS, and HIPAA. The findings from compromise assessments can also guide the enhancement of security controls, helping your organisation maintain ongoing compliance.
