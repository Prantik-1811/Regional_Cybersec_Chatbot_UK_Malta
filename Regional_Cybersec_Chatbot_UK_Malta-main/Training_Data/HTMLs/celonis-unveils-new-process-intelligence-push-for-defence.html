SecurityBrief UK - Technology news for CISOs & cybersecurity decision-makers United Kingdom Guides # cloud security # cybersecurity # endpoint protection # firewalls # ransomware Search # Digital Transformation # Physical Security # Supply Chain Celonis unveils new process intelligence push for defence Fri, 6th Feb 2026 (Today) By Sofiah Nichole Salivio, News Editor Celonis has launched a defence and security initiative targeting military agencies and defence suppliers under pressure to improve operational execution and readiness. The programme, Celonis for Defence & Security, positions its process intelligence software as a platform for operational oversight in environments with complex logistics, maintenance cycles and multi-tier supply chains. It includes a "sovereign solution" designed to integrate data across systems used by defence organisations. Defence procurement and sustainment have risen on political and industrial agendas in Europe as governments focus on stockpiles, production capacity and supply-line resilience. In parallel, software providers have stepped up efforts to adapt enterprise tools for defence buyers, which often have strict requirements for data governance, access control and interoperability with legacy systems. Focus Areas Celonis said the initiative addresses three areas. The first is mission readiness, focused on logistics planning and maintenance, repair and operations processes. This includes improving asset availability and reducing downtime caused by delays in parts, scheduling and maintenance workflows. The second area is industrial resilience across defence supply chains. Celonis said it can provide end-to-end visibility and reduce lead-time variability. This has become a priority for governments and prime contractors that rely on geographically dispersed supplier networks and face disruption risks. The third area is modernisation. Celonis said its platform can serve as a data integration layer connecting older IT systems with AI applications. Defence organisations often run a mix of bespoke applications and commercial enterprise systems, making it difficult to maintain a consistent view of operational performance. Executive View Celonis President and Board Director Carsten Thoma framed the launch as a response to structural shifts in European security policy and defence planning. "Europe's security architecture is undergoing a profound transformation-driven by rising geopolitical pressure and a strategic decoupling from external guarantors. But that transformation is being held back by the underlying processes, which are often brittle, outdated and dangerously slow," said Carsten Thoma, President and Board Director, Celonis. He added: "Celonis helps provide the foundation for organizations to continuously transform, optimize, and collaborate at scale - so they can meet the needs of the present moment." Supplier Demand Celonis also cited a Tier 1 defence supplier that pointed to operational delays and delivery performance as areas of focus. "With Celonis, we can connect data from across our production and supply ecosystem, eliminating delays and improving delivery performance for our government partners." Celonis said the initiative builds on existing work with defence suppliers, including CycloTech, Daimler Truck, KNDS and Navantia. Defence suppliers have faced increasing scrutiny from governments over delivery schedules, production ramp-ups and the availability of platforms and systems already in service. Process intelligence products are typically used to analyse how work flows through business systems such as enterprise resource planning, manufacturing execution, procurement and logistics. Vendors aim to surface bottlenecks, compliance gaps and variation across sites and programmes. In defence settings, this work often intersects with regulated data environments and multi-party programmes involving governments, prime contractors and large supplier bases. Celonis is headquartered in Munich and New York and operates more than 20 offices globally. The company has built its business around process mining and related analytics, and says its platform integrates process data and business context to create a "living digital twin of business operations". Industry Events Celonis said it will showcase the defence and security initiative during the Munich Security Conference 2026. It also plans to host a Celonis for Defence Pre-MSC Summit in Munich, bringing together defence leaders to discuss industrial resilience and strategic autonomy. Celonis said the summit will examine how process intelligence is used in defence manufacturing and sustainment as governments and suppliers seek tighter oversight of production capacity, logistics performance and supply availability.
