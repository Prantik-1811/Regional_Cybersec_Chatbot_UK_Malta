Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Managed Detection & Response (MDR) Threat Hunting Our team is relentless in finding the stealthiest & most sophisticated threats that pose the highest risk to our clients’ critical operations. Exposing advanced & novel threats. CYSIAM's Threat Hunting capability is a proactive security approach that involves the identification and mitigation of persistent threats and other cyber-attacks. Traditional security monitoring tools and techniques may not be enough to detect and respond to these sophisticated threats, which can blend in silently and lead to a breach if they remain undetected. That's where CYSIAM's expert threat hunters come in. This is an advanced form of investigation as it is primarily concerned with finding threats that normal detection methods can’t find; behavioural evidence based on the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of advanced threat actors. Speak to us Our Approach CYSIAM takes a proactive approach to identifying malicious activity and persistent threat hunting performed by skilled analysts is one of the most successful forms of detection. Threat hunting uses the threat model of an organisation and technical threat intelligence to hypothesise how potential attacks would manifest on a network, and then carry out an investigation or ‘hunt’ for that threat. Within the CYSIAM, threat hunting is not a one-time event but rather a continuous process that requires vigilance and expertise. Once we have established the main details for your enterprise environment and sector, we will use our threat intelligence team to build a profile of adversaries, their preferred TTPs and Infrastructure, and then build a working hypothesis for our investigation(s). Our threat hunting capability both supports, and is supported by, our Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) team and our 24x7 UK-based Security Operations Centre (SOC). Benefits Early Detection of Threats: By proactively hunting for threats, we identify potential security incidents earlier, reducing the risk of damage to the organisation. Improved Response Times: We ensure that our clients respond quickly to emerging threats and reduce the impact of security incidents. Enhanced Security Posture: By identifying and mitigating threats, we help our clients improve their overall security posture and reduce the risk of future cyber-attacks. Reduce Incident impact: Early detection and response to security incidents can reduce downtime and financial loss associated with cyber-attacks.
