The services it provides require strong defence mechanisms to effectively handle evolving cyber threats. Recognising the need for a more integrated solution, the business proactively decided to update its cybersecurity strategy by partnering with Reliance Cyber. This collaboration enabled the company to consolidate their systems into a unified and robust solution, enhancing security infrastructure and operational efficiency as well as controlling costs. The Challenge With an expansive array of services, this MSP demanded a sophisticated cybersecurity framework to safeguard sensitive customer data and ensure uninterrupted service delivery.

This phase involved: In-depth System Assessment: Detailed audits of all security tools were carried out to assess their effectiveness, identify redundancies, and determine integration capabilities. Strategic Roadmap Development: A detailed integration roadmap was crafted, prioritising critical assets and business functions to ensure a smooth and minimally disruptive rollout. Phase 2: System Integration This phase focused on the technical integration of Reliance Cyber’s XDR solution into the business’s IT infrastructure, aimed at enhancing capabilities without disrupting ongoing operations: Customisation and Configuration: The XDR system was customised to align with the business’s specific security needs.
