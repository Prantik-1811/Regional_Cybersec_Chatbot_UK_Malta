SecurityBrief UK - Technology news for CISOs & cybersecurity decision-makers United Kingdom Guides # cloud security # cybersecurity # endpoint protection # firewalls # ransomware Search # Firewalls # Network Infrastructure # DevOps Nebula & Meter partner to scale global network services Thu, 5th Feb 2026 (Yesterday) By Mark Tarre, News Chief Nebula Global Services has struck a strategic partnership with enterprise networking provider Meter to expand Meter's reach through resellers and improve deployment delivery and ongoing support across multiple countries. The agreement links Meter's subscription-based networking offering with Nebula's deployment and service operations. Nebula will provide deployment services, global logistics, and lifecycle support for Meter's reseller ecosystem, the firms said. Channel partners are central to how networking vendors enter new markets, particularly where customers want consistent installation standards and ongoing service across distributed sites. Under the partnership, Nebula becomes a service layer for Meter partners, focused on regions where resellers may not have their own field teams. "Enterprises are demanding networks that are easier to deploy, simpler to operate, and ready to scale. Meter's full-stack, subscription-based approach pairs perfectly with Nebula's global service delivery model. Together, we give channel partners a differentiated way to accelerate outcomes for their customers," said Ross Teague, CEO of Nebula Global Services. Network subscription Meter sells a networking subscription that bundles hardware, software, and managed services. Its hardware line-up includes firewalls, switches, access points, and gateways. It also provides software for configuration and operations, alongside a managed service wrapper. The offer fits within the broader "networking as a service" model, which frames network rollouts and upgrades as recurring operating expenditure rather than capital investment. Meter says this can reduce unexpected spending tied to hardware refresh cycles and large deployment projects. Meter Command is the company's operations software layer, with autonomous functions and AI-driven techniques for configuration, monitoring, and issue remediation. The partnership does not change Meter's product structure, but adds a delivery partner that can take responsibility for installation work and ongoing field support across geographies. Services wrap Nebula plans to provide certified installation, project management, support, and service governance through its Nebulab Professional & Managed Services. It operates under ISO 27001, ISO 14001, and ISO 9001-standards covering information security management, environmental management, and quality management. For Meter's reseller partners, the practical impact centres on who performs on-site work, how equipment moves across borders, and how service requests are handled after deployment. Global logistics can limit channel partners selling into multinational accounts, especially when hardware, replacement parts, and engineer availability must align with local regulations and customer security requirements. The companies said the arrangement is designed to help partners deliver deployments faster. Nebula said it can cut the time from order to an operational network from months to weeks, depending on project scope and the customer's estate. "Owning the full stack lets us deliver performant, reliable, and secure networks at scale. Partnering with Nebula Global Services extends that promise globally, ensuring customers receive consistent deployment quality and lifecycle support wherever they operate," said Mike McGonigle, sales lead for EMEA at Meter. Channel focus Nebula operates as a channel services provider, working with managed service providers, value-added resellers, and systems integrators. It operates in more than 160 countries and works with an ecosystem of more than 7,400 technical and service delivery specialists. That footprint is central to the partnership. For Meter, which is headquartered in San Francisco, it provides installation and support capacity in markets where it may not have a direct services presence. For Nebula, the deal adds a networking platform provider to its portfolio and a route to more network deployment work through Meter's reseller base. The partnership comes as IT teams face continued pressure to simplify branch and campus networks, standardise security controls, and maintain performance across Wi‑Fi and wired infrastructure. Buyers are also increasingly asking vendors and partners to take on more operational responsibility after installation, rather than handing over documentation and leaving day-to-day network changes to internal staff. Meter provides internet infrastructure for businesses, covering connectivity, networking, Wi‑Fi, and cellular coverage inside customer spaces. It works with partners and charges a predictable monthly fee for its service. The companies expect to take the joint approach to Meter's reseller ecosystem, with Nebula providing delivery and lifecycle services as deployments expand into additional regions.
