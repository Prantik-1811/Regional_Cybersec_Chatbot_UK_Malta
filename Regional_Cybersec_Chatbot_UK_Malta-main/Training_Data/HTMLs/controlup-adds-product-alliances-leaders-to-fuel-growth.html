SecurityBrief UK - Technology news for CISOs & cybersecurity decision-makers United Kingdom Guides # cloud security # cybersecurity # endpoint protection # firewalls # ransomware Search # Virtualisation # IT Automation # Partner Programmes ControlUp adds product & alliances leaders to fuel growth Thu, 5th Feb 2026 (Yesterday) By Sofiah Nichole Salivio, News Editor ControlUp has expanded its executive leadership team, appointing Gadi Feldman as Chief Product Officer and Bob Johnson as Senior Vice President of Global Alliances and Partnerships. ControlUp, which sells software for digital employee experience management, said the hires mark a new phase in its growth plans, with greater emphasis on product strategy and its partner ecosystem. Chief Executive Officer Jed Ayres said the appointments reflect the demands of scaling both product development and partner delivery. "ControlUp is scaling rapidly and expanding our leadership team is essential to sustaining that momentum," said Jed Ayres, CEO of ControlUp. "Gadi brings deep technical leadership and product vision that will accelerate innovation across our platform, while Bob's experience building global partner ecosystems will help us extend that innovation through strategic alliances and joint go-to-market initiatives worldwide. Together, they strengthen our ability to execute at scale while staying focused on delivering meaningful customer value." Product Focus Feldman will be responsible for product innovation and strategy, including automation features and systems that surface operational insights. ControlUp also plans to expand proactive IT capabilities within workplace computing environments. Feldman returned to ControlUp following its acquisition of Takoto, the Israel-based automation and engineering business he co-founded. ControlUp completed the acquisition in 2025. He previously spent seven years at ControlUp in leadership roles before launching Takoto. He has held senior engineering and product roles at Google, Citrix and HPE. ControlUp also highlighted his experience in cybersecurity and large-scale software development. ControlUp positions its product around managing employee device experience and endpoint operations, combining monitoring and analytics with remedial workflows. It also promotes a shift toward autonomous endpoint management, with more automated detection and resolution of device and application issues. Feldman said his priorities include scaling product development and increasing the platform's intelligence. "As ControlUp grows, our opportunity to redefine how IT teams manage digital experience continues to expand," said Feldman. "My focus is on building scalable, intelligent products that help IT move from reactive troubleshooting to proactive, automated operations while staying grounded in real-world customer needs." Partner Strategy Johnson will lead global alliances and partnerships across technology partners, channel organisations and managed service providers. His remit includes commercial relationships and joint go-to-market work, including coordinated selling, marketing and delivery with partners. ControlUp sells through a mix of direct and partner-led routes. Channel relationships can influence adoption in larger organisations, particularly where managed service providers take responsibility for endpoint operations. Johnson has more than 25 years of experience across large technology suppliers and smaller businesses. He has worked at Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Cadence Design Systems, as well as startups. He described the role as an opportunity to extend ControlUp's reach through partner-led solutions and joint initiatives. "Strong partnerships are essential to delivering customer value at scale," said Johnson. "ControlUp has a powerful platform and a clear vision for the future of digital employee experience. I'm excited to work closely with our technology and channel partners to co-develop solutions, expand joint go-to-market initiatives, and help customers realize measurable outcomes faster." Market Context Digital employee experience management has become a distinct segment within workplace IT, drawing budget from endpoint management, IT service management and monitoring tools. Employers have continued to invest in approaches that improve device reliability and application performance, as hybrid working increases the need for remote support and visibility. ControlUp says it serves nearly 2,000 organisations, including more than one-third of the Fortune 100. It describes its platform as combining digital employee experience and IT operations in a single product. The leadership announcements coincided with the company's EMEA channel summit at Wembley Stadium in London. ControlUp said the event drew hundreds of partners and included product roadmap updates and details of its ControlUp Drive DX partner programme. Ayres said the leadership additions strengthen both product direction and partner execution. "The combination of product leadership and partner strategy is a force multiplier for our business," said Ayres. "With Gadi and Bob in these key roles, we're well positioned to scale responsibly, innovate faster, and deliver even greater value to our customers and partners."
