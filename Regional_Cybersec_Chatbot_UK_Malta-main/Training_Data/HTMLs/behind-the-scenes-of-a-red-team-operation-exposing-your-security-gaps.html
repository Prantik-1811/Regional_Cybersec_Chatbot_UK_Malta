Pen Testing In the quiet moments before dawn, a team of CyberCrowd security experts pored over maps, social media profiles, and building layouts, preparing for a task that could redefine their client’s security. This wasn’t a drill; it was a Red Team engagement – a real-world simulation designed to uncover vulnerabilities in both digital and physical security systems. What is Red Teaming? Red Teaming is a high-stakes, threat-led method of security testing that goes beyond checklists and compliance. It’s a true-to-life simulation of a determined cyberattack, employing the same tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that real-world hackers or even nation-state actors might use to breach defences. At CyberCrowd, our expert Red Team pen testers take a comprehensive approach, blending technical prowess, social engineering, and creative problem-solving to uncover vulnerabilities wherever they may exist – within networks, systems, buildings, processes, or even among people. By simulating the actions of a persistent adversary, Red Teaming provides unparalleled insights into your organisation’s security, highlighting weaknesses and opportunities for improvement in ways no traditional test can. Red teaming can be divided into distinct attack scenarios, each with unique objectives: Red Team : Focused on stealth and uncovering vulnerabilities across the organisation. Black Team : Operating with zero prior knowledge to replicate an outsider threat. Purple Team : A collaborative approach where attackers and defenders work together to enhance security. Assumed Breach : Testing post-compromise scenarios to evaluate incident response. EDR/XDR Testing : Assessing the efficacy of endpoint detection and extended detection solutions. This goal-oriented approach challenges assumptions, eliminates biases, and replicates the persistence and determination of real-world attackers, providing invaluable insights into your security landscape. Preparation: The Art of Knowing Your Target Before setting foot on-site, CyberCrowd begins every engagement with meticulous Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering. Leveraging publicly available information, our team pieces together a detailed picture of the target organisation, identifying vulnerabilities long before attempting access. For instance, tools like Google Maps and social media platforms such as LinkedIn provide critical details: Layouts of offices and external access points. Employee routines, workwear, and ID badge designs. Details shared by employees, such as operational insights or seemingly harmless photos revealing potential weak points. Blending In to Stand Out: Exposing Security Weaknesses Through Human Behaviour In a recent engagement, the CyberCrowd team demonstrated its ingenuity by identifying a specific lanyard style used by employees and recreating it, allowing them to blend seamlessly on-site. This approach, combined with subtle inconsistencies in replicated workwear and badges, was designed not to perfectly mimic but to test the vigilance and security awareness of staff. Observing behaviours such as employees sharing photos online with visible security details, the team capitalised on this information to craft realistic yet intentionally flawed replicas. These efforts not only tested physical security measures but also highlighted a critical vulnerability: the human factor, revealing how small oversights can have significant security implications. Reconnaissance: The On-Site Advantage Once on-site, CyberCrowd’s experts conducted reconnaissance to observe and document employee behaviours, building layouts, and security measures, using techniques such as: Tailgating: Following an employee through secure doors without being questioned. Distraction: Creating minor diversions to exploit lapses in vigilance. Social Engineering: Engaging employees in casual conversation to extract sensitive information. By monitoring staff routines and testing access protocols, the team uncovered critical weaknesses, including unlocked doors, unverified credentials, and poor visitor monitoring – common vulnerabilities that could lead to significant breaches. A Friendly Chat, a Security Breach: Highlighting the Need for Vigilance and Training In one instance, a tester engaged an employee in friendly conversation while gaining entry to a restricted area, exposing gaps in both physical security and employee training to recognise and respond to potential threats. These exercises revealed how easily small lapses in vigilance could be exploited, emphasizing the importance of robust security awareness and training. The Benefits of a Red Team Engagement Red Teaming replicates a real-world hacking attempt by a determined adversary, allowing organisations to: Discover and categorise risks across physical, digital, and human factors. Evaluate detection and response capabilities against advanced threats. Challenge assumptions by eliminating internal biases with external, objective testing. These engagements provide a roadmap to strengthen defences and protect against future attacks, empowering organisations to proactively address their vulnerabilities. CyberCrowd: Your Trusted Partner in Security At CyberCrowd, we pride ourselves on delivering bespoke, tailored tests that align with your organisation’s needs. Our CREST-accredited team designs each Red Team engagement to provide actionable insights and prioritise improvements. What sets CyberCrowd apart? Bespoke Scenarios : Tailored to your organisation’s specific risk profile. Expert Team : Decades of combined experience in cybersecurity and penetration testing. Unique Insights : Clear, prioritised recommendations to enhance security. Red Teaming is a stealthy, goal-oriented procedure that tests not only the systems and protocols in place but also the people managing them. Unlike traditional penetration testing, the lack of prior notice forces organisations to respond as if facing an actual attack, providing a far more accurate assessment of real-world readiness. With CyberCrowd, you’ll gain a comprehensive understanding of your defences and the confidence to tackle even the most sophisticated threats. Let’s work together to safeguard your future.

This wasn’t a drill; it was a Red Team engagement – a real-world simulation designed to uncover vulnerabilities in both digital and physical security systems. What is Red Teaming? Red Teaming is a high-stakes, threat-led method of security testing that goes beyond checklists and compliance. It’s a true-to-life simulation of a determined cyberattack, employing the same tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that real-world hackers or even nation-state actors might use to breach defences. At CyberCrowd, our expert Red Team pen testers take a comprehensive approach, blending technical prowess, social engineering, and creative problem-solving to uncover vulnerabilities wherever they may exist – within networks, systems, buildings, processes, or even among people. By simulating the actions of a persistent adversary, Red Teaming provides unparalleled insights into your organisation’s security, highlighting weaknesses and opportunities for improvement in ways no traditional test can. Red teaming can be divided into distinct attack scenarios, each with unique objectives: Red Team : Focused on stealth and uncovering vulnerabilities across the organisation. Black Team : Operating with zero prior knowledge to replicate an outsider threat. Purple Team : A collaborative approach where attackers and defenders work together to enhance security. Assumed Breach : Testing post-compromise scenarios to evaluate incident response. EDR/XDR Testing : Assessing the efficacy of endpoint detection and extended detection solutions. This goal-oriented approach challenges assumptions, eliminates biases, and replicates the persistence and determination of real-world attackers, providing invaluable insights into your security landscape. Preparation: The Art of Knowing Your Target Before setting foot on-site, CyberCrowd begins every engagement with meticulous Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering. Leveraging publicly available information, our team pieces together a detailed picture of the target organisation, identifying vulnerabilities long before attempting access. For instance, tools like Google Maps and social media platforms such as LinkedIn provide critical details: Layouts of offices and external access points. Employee routines, workwear, and ID badge designs. Details shared by employees, such as operational insights or seemingly harmless photos revealing potential weak points. Blending In to Stand Out: Exposing Security Weaknesses Through Human Behaviour In a recent engagement, the CyberCrowd team demonstrated its ingenuity by identifying a specific lanyard style used by employees and recreating it, allowing them to blend seamlessly on-site. This approach, combined with subtle inconsistencies in replicated workwear and badges, was designed not to perfectly mimic but to test the vigilance and security awareness of staff. Observing behaviours such as employees sharing photos online with visible security details, the team capitalised on this information to craft realistic yet intentionally flawed replicas. These efforts not only tested physical security measures but also highlighted a critical vulnerability: the human factor, revealing how small oversights can have significant security implications. Reconnaissance: The On-Site Advantage Once on-site, CyberCrowd’s experts conducted reconnaissance to observe and document employee behaviours, building layouts, and security measures, using techniques such as: Tailgating: Following an employee through secure doors without being questioned. Distraction: Creating minor diversions to exploit lapses in vigilance. Social Engineering: Engaging employees in casual conversation to extract sensitive information. By monitoring staff routines and testing access protocols, the team uncovered critical weaknesses, including unlocked doors, unverified credentials, and poor visitor monitoring – common vulnerabilities that could lead to significant breaches. A Friendly Chat, a Security Breach: Highlighting the Need for Vigilance and Training In one instance, a tester engaged an employee in friendly conversation while gaining entry to a restricted area, exposing gaps in both physical security and employee training to recognise and respond to potential threats. These exercises revealed how easily small lapses in vigilance could be exploited, emphasizing the importance of robust security awareness and training. The Benefits of a Red Team Engagement Red Teaming replicates a real-world hacking attempt by a determined adversary, allowing organisations to: Discover and categorise risks across physical, digital, and human factors. Evaluate detection and response capabilities against advanced threats. Challenge assumptions by eliminating internal biases with external, objective testing. These engagements provide a roadmap to strengthen defences and protect against future attacks, empowering organisations to proactively address their vulnerabilities. CyberCrowd: Your Trusted Partner in Security At CyberCrowd, we pride ourselves on delivering bespoke, tailored tests that align with your organisation’s needs. Our CREST-accredited team designs each Red Team engagement to provide actionable insights and prioritise improvements. What sets CyberCrowd apart? Bespoke Scenarios : Tailored to your organisation’s specific risk profile. Expert Team : Decades of combined experience in cybersecurity and penetration testing.

Blending In to Stand Out: Exposing Security Weaknesses Through Human Behaviour In a recent engagement, the CyberCrowd team demonstrated its ingenuity by identifying a specific lanyard style used by employees and recreating it, allowing them to blend seamlessly on-site. This approach, combined with subtle inconsistencies in replicated workwear and badges, was designed not to perfectly mimic but to test the vigilance and security awareness of staff. Observing behaviours such as employees sharing photos online with visible security details, the team capitalised on this information to craft realistic yet intentionally flawed replicas. These efforts not only tested physical security measures but also highlighted a critical vulnerability: the human factor, revealing how small oversights can have significant security implications. Reconnaissance: The On-Site Advantage Once on-site, CyberCrowd’s experts conducted reconnaissance to observe and document employee behaviours, building layouts, and security measures, using techniques such as: Tailgating: Following an employee through secure doors without being questioned. Distraction: Creating minor diversions to exploit lapses in vigilance. Social Engineering: Engaging employees in casual conversation to extract sensitive information. By monitoring staff routines and testing access protocols, the team uncovered critical weaknesses, including unlocked doors, unverified credentials, and poor visitor monitoring – common vulnerabilities that could lead to significant breaches. A Friendly Chat, a Security Breach: Highlighting the Need for Vigilance and Training In one instance, a tester engaged an employee in friendly conversation while gaining entry to a restricted area, exposing gaps in both physical security and employee training to recognise and respond to potential threats. These exercises revealed how easily small lapses in vigilance could be exploited, emphasizing the importance of robust security awareness and training. The Benefits of a Red Team Engagement Red Teaming replicates a real-world hacking attempt by a determined adversary, allowing organisations to: Discover and categorise risks across physical, digital, and human factors. Evaluate detection and response capabilities against advanced threats. Challenge assumptions by eliminating internal biases with external, objective testing. These engagements provide a roadmap to strengthen defences and protect against future attacks, empowering organisations to proactively address their vulnerabilities. CyberCrowd: Your Trusted Partner in Security At CyberCrowd, we pride ourselves on delivering bespoke, tailored tests that align with your organisation’s needs. Our CREST-accredited team designs each Red Team engagement to provide actionable insights and prioritise improvements. What sets CyberCrowd apart? Bespoke Scenarios : Tailored to your organisation’s specific risk profile. Expert Team : Decades of combined experience in cybersecurity and penetration testing. Unique Insights : Clear, prioritised recommendations to enhance security. Red Teaming is a stealthy, goal-oriented procedure that tests not only the systems and protocols in place but also the people managing them. Unlike traditional penetration testing, the lack of prior notice forces organisations to respond as if facing an actual attack, providing a far more accurate assessment of real-world readiness. With CyberCrowd, you’ll gain a comprehensive understanding of your defences and the confidence to tackle even the most sophisticated threats. Let’s work together to safeguard your future. Related Resource: READ NOW: Inside the Action: A Red Team Physical Penetration Test in Action A Day in the life of CyberCrowd’s Head of Penetration Testing In the quiet moments before dawn, a team of CyberCrowd security experts pored over maps, social media profiles, and building layouts, preparing for a task that could redefine their client’s security. This wasn’t a drill; it was a Red Team engagement – a real-world simulation designed to uncover vulnerabilities in both digital and physical security systems. What is Red Teaming? Red Teaming is a high-stakes, threat-led method of security testing that goes beyond checklists and compliance. It’s a true-to-life simulation of a determined cyberattack, employing the same tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that real-world hackers or even nation-state actors might use to breach defences. At CyberCrowd, our expert Red Team pen testers take a comprehensive approach, blending technical prowess, social engineering, and creative problem-solving to uncover vulnerabilities wherever they may exist – within networks, systems, buildings, processes, or even among people. By simulating the actions of a persistent adversary, Red Teaming provides unparalleled insights into your organisation’s security, highlighting weaknesses and opportunities for improvement in ways no traditional test can. Red teaming can be divided into distinct attack scenarios, each with unique objectives: Red Team : Focused on stealth and uncovering vulnerabilities across the organisation. Black Team : Operating with zero prior knowledge to replicate an outsider threat. Purple Team : A collaborative approach where attackers and defenders work together to enhance security. Assumed Breach : Testing post-compromise scenarios to evaluate incident response. EDR/XDR Testing : Assessing the efficacy of endpoint detection and extended detection solutions. This goal-oriented approach challenges assumptions, eliminates biases, and replicates the persistence and determination of real-world attackers, providing invaluable insights into your security landscape. Preparation: The Art of Knowing Your Target Before setting foot on-site, CyberCrowd begins every engagement with meticulous Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering. Leveraging publicly available information, our team pieces together a detailed picture of the target organisation, identifying vulnerabilities long before attempting access.
