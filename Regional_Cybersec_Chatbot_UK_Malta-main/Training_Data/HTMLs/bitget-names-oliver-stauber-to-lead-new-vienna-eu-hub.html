The company said Europe remains a core strategic region under its "Universal Exchange" approach. It linked its regional plans to MiCAR, the bloc's framework for crypto-asset service providers, which introduces common rules on governance, disclosures and operational requirements across the EU. Stauber joins Bitget EU from KuCoin EU Holding in Vienna, where he served as Managing Director and Chief Executive. He previously held senior roles at Bitpanda, including Chief Legal Officer, with responsibility for group legal, regulatory and compliance functions, as well as licensing and supervisory engagement across multiple jurisdictions. Bitget said the Vienna base will act as its European headquarters and a hub for compliance and governance work. The company also described it as a centre for supervisory coordination across the European Economic Area. "Oliver's appointment builds our confidence in Bitget's long-term presence in Europe," said Gracy Chen, CEO, Bitget. "He brings the regulatory fluency and operational discipline needed to set up our EU headquarters in Austria and strengthen a governance-first approach under MiCAR. His role is to lead a scalable, compliant regional platform that protects users, earns regulator confidence through transparency, and supports sustainable growth across the EU." Vienna hub The company said it intends to focus on engagement with regulators and internal controls as it develops its European structure. It said it plans to align with local requirements in markets where services may be offered. The appointment comes as crypto firms restructure European operations to match MiCAR's approach. The regulation creates an authorisation regime for crypto-asset service providers and sets out requirements on governance, conflict management, prudential safeguards and communications with clients. It also introduces obligations around handling client assets and maintaining operational resilience. Bitget positioned Stauber's background as relevant to that shift. His experience spans legal and regulatory work and executive management in crypto and financial services, according to the company. Stauber said MiCAR raised the bar for governance and risk practices in the sector. "MiCAR is resetting expectations for how digital-asset services are governed in Europe, from risk controls to disclosures and operational discipline," said Stauber. "Our HQ in Vienna will build a regulated, scalable setup ready to drive the future of finance in Europe and to serve EEA users reliably by offering secure, efficient, and smart digital transactions, supported by robust risk controls, transparent operations, and a strong commitment to user protection and regulatory standards." Regulatory steps Bitget said its European roadmap will prioritise regulatory readiness, compliance foundations and operational transparency. It framed that work as part of an effort to meet supervisory expectations in the region. The company also stated that Bitget EU does not currently offer services in the EU or EEA. It said it will commence operations after receiving the relevant regulatory authorisation or licensing. Bitget EU is based in Vienna and plans to operate as a Crypto-Asset Service Provider under MiCAR. The wider Bitget group said it serves more than 125 million users globally and offers access to crypto tokens and tokenised assets, including tokenised stocks and exchange-traded funds, as well as commodities, foreign exchange and precious metals. Bitget said it operates across 150 regions worldwide. It also cited partnerships including LALIGA and MotoGP, and an initiative with UNICEF focused on blockchain education. The company said the Vienna headquarters will sit at the centre of its planned European operating model as it progresses through the authorisation process under MiCAR.
