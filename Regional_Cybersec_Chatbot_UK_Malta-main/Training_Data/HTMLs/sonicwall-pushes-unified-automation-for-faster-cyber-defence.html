SecurityBrief UK - Technology news for CISOs & cybersecurity decision-makers United Kingdom Guides # cloud security # cybersecurity # endpoint protection # firewalls # ransomware Search # Malware # Firewalls # Ransomware SonicWall pushes unified automation for faster cyber defence Fri, 23rd Jan 2026 By Amelia Foss, Product Marketing Specialist, SonicWall Organisations today face significant challenges in automating security processes and remediating threats swiftly. Key obstacles include integration complexities with existing systems, lack of skilled personnel, and the sheer volume of alerts leading to alert fatigue. These issues make it difficult to respond to incidents in real-time and can result in delayed threat mitigation, increasing the risk of security breaches. Volume and speed of threats Modern organizations are confronted with a relentless barrage of cyberattacks that manifest at unprecedented speed and scale. Threats such as malware, ransomware, credential theft, and zero-day exploits are now launched and propagated at machine speed, often outpacing the ability of human responders to react in real time. Cyberattacks such as malware, ransomware, credential theft, and zero-day exploits occur at machine speed, overwhelming traditional defense mechanisms. To combat this scenario, manual responses are unable to keep pace with these automated attacks, resulting in increased organizational risk and prolonged exposure to threats. As a result, relying solely on manual intervention leaves organizations vulnerable, as the speed and volume of threats continue to escalate. Effective automation and rapid response are required to mitigate risk and contain threats before they can cause significant harm. Siloed security tools Even today, we find that many organizations rely on a diverse array of disconnected security products. This fragmented approach results in siloed tools that do not communicate effectively with one another or share critical threat intelligence. The absence of centralized visibility across these disparate systems creates significant challenges for security teams. Without a unified view, it becomes increasingly difficult to correlate alerts from multiple sources and understand the full scope of potential threats facing the organization. Additionally, this lack of integration hinders automation, making it challenging to implement consistent and coordinated response actions across the environment. As a result, organizations struggle to keep pace with threats and efficiently remediate incidents, ultimately increasing their exposure to security risks. Inconsistent response actions A key challenge in cybersecurity automation is inconsistent manual response actions across systems. Tasks like password resets, device reconfiguration, or patching often depend on IT staff, which leads to slow, error-prone processes that vary by system and person. These delays not only hinder incident response but also increase risk. Streamlining and automating remediation is essential for maintaining an effective security posture. Skill shortage & analyst fatigue One of the most pressing challenges facing cybersecurity teams today is the shortage of skilled professionals. The growing complexity and volume of threats have created a significant demand for talent, yet the supply of qualified cybersecurity experts remains limited. This gap places immense pressure on existing teams as they strive to defend their organizations against a continuous stream of attacks. Compounding the issue is the prevalence of high false-positive rates produced by security tools. Teams are frequently inundated with alerts, many of which do not represent genuine threats. Sifting through these numerous false alarms can quickly overwhelm analysts, leading to fatigue and decreased efficiency. As a result, critical real threats may be overlooked, and overall team effectiveness is undermined. Addressing security challenges requires unified, automated solutions that enable IT teams to respond quickly and consistently. SonicWall offers a comprehensive suite of tools for automated detection, response, and integration, providing centralized management to reduce risks. By leveraging advanced automation and a unified security platform, organizations can streamline incident response, minimize manual intervention, and enhance visibility across their environment. This integrated approach not only accelerates threat detection and remediation but also empowers security teams to operate more efficiently, reducing analyst fatigue and enabling consistent, effective protection against evolving cyber risks.
