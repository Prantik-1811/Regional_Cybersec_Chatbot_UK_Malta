Rob’s appointment follows a period of sustained growth for Reliance Cyber, whereby the firm has generated £10.6million revenue in the past year, almost doubling the figure from two years ago. In his new role, Rob is responsible for all customer relationship management and business development activities. He will be focused on making sure that all customers remain informed, secure and ahead of constantly evolving cyber threats. Joining Reliance Cyber with over 30 years’ diverse experience in the IT industry, Rob has worked with both public and private sector organisations across a wide range of industry sectors. While working for large multi-national companies such as Oracle, Sun Microsystems and Fujitsu, Rob’s management roles have seen him deliver strong revenue growth both directly and indirectly, through and with channel partners, covering the entire enterprise technology stack. Speaking on Rob’s appointment, Martin Sutherland, CEO at Reliance Cyber said: “At present, we are focused on developing our service capabilities and sustaining our high level of business growth. Rob’s impressive experience will help to support this expansion and he will play an integral role in further growing our strong client portfolio and presence within the sector. “Rob brings a strong understanding of how to scale businesses whilst ensuring client satisfaction remains the utmost priority at all times.” Rob commented: “I’m looking forward to building strong working relationships with Reliance Cyber’s customers and the wider industry to ensure we are a trusted source of expertise in the market. We are committed to developing new service capabilities and I will be focused on supporting our clients to implement new processes while staying ahead of any potential threats that may arise.” Reliance Cyber delivers vendor-independent cyber security advice and managed services to global brands, empowering businesses and enabling them to flourish by defending them with the best people and right technology.
