Reject All Save My Preferences Accept All Powered by Reject All Save My Preferences Accept All Blog Post Thought leadership: Why PIPA matters – Lessons from global data privacy regulation and enforcement Reliance Cyber - 26 November 2024 Estimated reading time: 1 minutes Contents PIPA – a new dawn for Data Privacy in Bermuda PIPA – a new dawn for Data Privacy in Bermuda Though the genesis of data privacy laws can be traced back decades, the recent era of regulation, spearheaded by the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that came into force in 2018, has revolutionised the way rules around processing personal data are enforced. In that vein, Bermuda’s Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) is a new addition to the global data privacy roster but follows in the footsteps of other similar regulations. Modelled after the EU GDPR, PIPA seeks to empower individuals, foster transparency, and hold organisations accountable for data handling. By examining both PIPA – and considering the lessons learned from nearly 6 years of GDPR enforcement – we can extract some interesting lessons from how privacy laws have been applied globally and what this might mean for the future of business operating in Bermuda.
