Pen Testing In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, ensuring the security and integrity of IT systems in educational institutions is more critical than ever. With the rise of digital threats, the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) mandates annual IT Health Checks (ITHCs) for further education (FE) institutions as part of their funding agreements. These checks are essential for protecting sensitive data and maintaining robust cybersecurity measures. They ensure that institutions are compliant, their IT estates are visible, external systems are safeguarded against unauthorised access, and internal systems are free from significant weaknesses. The key question is: Is your college equipped to meet these requirements and safeguard its IT estate from potential cyber threats? Why Are IT Health Checks Important? IT Health Checks are essential for identifying vulnerabilities in your IT systems. They help safeguard against unauthorised access and ensure that your internal systems are secure and up to date. Regular checks not only protect sensitive student and staff data but also help manage a diverse and complex IT infrastructure, mitigating risks from unsupported software and unpatched systems. Key Components of the ITHC An IT Health Check encompasses several critical components, including: External Testing : Focuses on systems accessible from outside the institution, such as email servers, web servers, and remote access solutions. Internal Testing : Ensures the integrity of the internal network and systems, including endpoints, servers, and network devices. Wi-Fi Security Assessment : Checks for unauthorised network entry points and ensures secure wireless communications. Firewall Rule Configuration Checks : Verifies that firewall rules are properly set to prevent unauthorised access. Device Build Reviews : Ensures that all devices, including laptops and desktops, are running the latest software versions and patches. Server Estate Assessment : Evaluates the security of both Windows and Linux servers within the institution’s IT estate. How Can IT Health Checks Benefit Your Institution? Immediate Risk Identification : Quickly uncover and address critical vulnerabilities. Enhanced Security Posture : Develop long-term strategies for ongoing protection. Compliance and Funding : Ensure your institution meets ESFA funding requirements.

Managing a Diverse IT Estate : Handling a wide range of devices and systems. Mitigating Risks : Addressing issues from unsupported software and unpatched systems. Ensuring Secure Access : Maintaining secure network access across multiple campuses. Planning & Approach: Fulfilling ITHC Requirements To fulfill ITHC requirements, a systematic and thorough approach is necessary. This involves: Comprehensive Penetration Testing : Simulating cyber-attacks to uncover vulnerabilities. Pen testing helps identify weaknesses before they can be exploited by malicious actors. Assessment of Vulnerabilities : Identifying typical issues such as unsupported software and default credentials still in use. Critical findings, if left unaddressed, could allow cybercriminals to access sensitive systems. Our approach is thorough and transparent, offering detailed reporting and recommendations via our secure Client Pen Test Portal. This portal provides real-time visibility into your IT Health Check results, including risk scores and suggested remedial actions for every identified vulnerability. Regular IT Health Checks and Ongoing Penetration Testing Regular IT Health Checks and ongoing penetration testing are essential for keeping up with evolving cyber threats. This proactive approach helps institutions stay ahead of potential risks and maintain a secure learning environment. Are You Ready to Protect Your Institution?

With the rise of digital threats, the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) mandates annual IT Health Checks (ITHCs) for further education (FE) institutions as part of their funding agreements. These checks are essential for protecting sensitive data and maintaining robust cybersecurity measures. They ensure that institutions are compliant, their IT estates are visible, external systems are safeguarded against unauthorised access, and internal systems are free from significant weaknesses. The key question is: Is your college equipped to meet these requirements and safeguard its IT estate from potential cyber threats? Why Are IT Health Checks Important? IT Health Checks are essential for identifying vulnerabilities in your IT systems. They help safeguard against unauthorised access and ensure that your internal systems are secure and up to date. Regular checks not only protect sensitive student and staff data but also help manage a diverse and complex IT infrastructure, mitigating risks from unsupported software and unpatched systems. Key Components of the ITHC An IT Health Check encompasses several critical components, including: External Testing : Focuses on systems accessible from outside the institution, such as email servers, web servers, and remote access solutions. Internal Testing : Ensures the integrity of the internal network and systems, including endpoints, servers, and network devices. Wi-Fi Security Assessment : Checks for unauthorised network entry points and ensures secure wireless communications. Firewall Rule Configuration Checks : Verifies that firewall rules are properly set to prevent unauthorised access. Device Build Reviews : Ensures that all devices, including laptops and desktops, are running the latest software versions and patches. Server Estate Assessment : Evaluates the security of both Windows and Linux servers within the institution’s IT estate. How Can IT Health Checks Benefit Your Institution? Immediate Risk Identification : Quickly uncover and address critical vulnerabilities. Enhanced Security Posture : Develop long-term strategies for ongoing protection. Compliance and Funding : Ensure your institution meets ESFA funding requirements.
