News Article by Rich Jones, CyberCrowd . Last week I had the pleasure of attending the National Cyber Security Show at the NEC in Birmingham – and it was great to see such strong engagement across the industry. From cutting-edge innovation to real-world insights, it was a great opportunity to stay ahead in the fast-moving world of cyber security. The Cyber Security Show formed part of the wider National Security Show , which brought together everything from the physical to the digital – think CCTV, security fencing, AI-powered surveillance, biometric access, secure locks, and even mobile sentries. It really showcased the full spectrum of modern security – the kind of stuff that gets James Bond and cyber geeks equally excited. A Strong Cyber Focus The Cyber Zone itself was buzzing. This area was all about Training & Awareness and Cyber Consultancy – two themes that are right at the heart of what we do at CyberCrowd. From conversations on evolving threats to how businesses of all sizes can boost their human firewall, it was refreshing to see so many organisations treating cyber resilience as a shared responsibility. I caught up with some of our industry friends and partners, including the fantastic team at IASME . It was great to chat with Chris Pinder (COO) and Jonathan Ellwood (Head of Incident Response) . We talked about: Updates to Cyber Essentials & Cyber Essentials Plus – changes that are coming down the line and what they mean for UK businesses. The growing focus on Incident Response – and the crucial role preparation plays in a strong defence strategy. If you’re not already looking into how CE and IR align with your business goals, now’s a good time to start. Key Themes: People, Processes, and Practical Action One of the biggest takeaways for me? Cyber security is no longer just about the tech. Yes, there were plenty of shiny tools and clever solutions on show (and I’ll admit, I do love a good gadget), but the real focus was on people and processes. From SMEs to enterprise, the conversations centred around: Building cyber awareness from the inside out Creating security cultures that actually stick Getting proactive, not reactive when it comes to risk As someone who lives and breathes cyber awareness and training, it’s encouraging to see how much progress we’re making as a community. It’s clear that more and more organisations are realising that their people are both their biggest risk and their greatest defence. Final Thoughts All in all, it was a fantastic event – well attended, full of energy, and packed with valuable takeaways. A great chance to reconnect with peers, partners, and the wider security world. If you didn’t make it this year, I’d highly recommend keeping it on your radar for 2026. In the meantime, if you want to talk Training & Awareness , Incident Response , or how CyberCrowd can support your cyber strategy, drop us a line – we’re always up for a good conversation (and probably a coffee too).
