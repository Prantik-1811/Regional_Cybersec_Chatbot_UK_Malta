Ellie-Rose Howe - 29 August 2025 Estimated reading time: 3 minutes Contents About the NCSC Cyber Incident Exercising (CIE) Scheme About Reliance Cyber LONDON – August 29th, 2025 – Reliance Cyber has been officially recognised as an Assured Service Provider under the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) Cyber Incident Exercising (CIE) scheme, validating its expertise in delivering realistic and high-impact cyber incident simulations. Developed by the NCSC in collaboration with CREST and IASME, the CIE scheme sets a nationally recognised standard for cyber exercising. It gives organisations confidence that they are working with approved partners who can rigorously test response plans and improve readiness at every level — from frontline analysts to the boardroom. As part of the scheme, Reliance Cyber is assured to deliver two core services: Table-Top Exercises Developed by the NCSC in collaboration with CREST and IASME, the CIE scheme sets a nationally recognised standard for cyber exercising. It gives organisations confidence that they are working with approved partners who can rigorously test response plans and improve readiness at every level — from frontline analysts to the boardroom. Reliance Cyber’s table-top exercises are available in different formats, including technical and executive board sessions, to specifically address the needs of various audiences within your organisation. Crisis Simulations Immersive, real-time exercises where participants respond to a simulated incident as it unfolds. Designed to replicate the pressure, ambiguity, and pace of a real attack, these exercises surface operational blind spots and test coordination across departments. All exercises are customisable, built around an organisation’s specific risk profile, regulatory context, and operational environment. Scenarios can range from ransomware affecting customer-facing systems to insider threats, supply chain compromise, or data breach crisis communications. Alex Martin, Cyber Services at Reliance Cyber, has said: “Reliance Cyber’s incident simulations are designed by practitioners who have led real responses and understand the operational, legal, and human realities of a cyber attack, Being certified under the NCSC scheme reinforces the level of trust clients place in us — not just to facilitate exercises, but to help their teams perform better when the stakes are highest.” About the NCSC Cyber Incident Exercising (CIE) Scheme The CIE scheme gives organisations a trusted way to benchmark their incident preparedness against nationally recognised standards. As an Assured Provider, Reliance Cyber will also feed anonymised insights from real exercises into the NCSC, supporting the continuous improvement of the UK’s cyber defence posture. About Reliance Cyber At Reliance Cyber, we go beyond standard cybersecurity services, we become an extension of your team, working as a trusted partner to defend against the most advanced threats, including those at a nation-state level.
