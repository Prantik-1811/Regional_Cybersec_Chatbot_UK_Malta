SecurityBrief UK - Technology news for CISOs & cybersecurity decision-makers United Kingdom Guides # cloud security # cybersecurity # endpoint protection # firewalls # ransomware Search # Digital Transformation # Cloud Security # Advanced Persistent Threat Protection Gartner crowns Tenable AI exposure assessment leader Fri, 30th Jan 2026 By Kaleah Salmon, News Editor Gartner has named Tenable as the "company to beat" in its AI-Powered Exposure Assessment category for 2025, citing Tenable's position in vulnerability assessment alongside broader attack surface discovery and AI-driven analysis. The research firm said Tenable reached "front-runner status" by combining vulnerability assessment with asset and attack-surface discovery, as well as support for third-party telemetry ingestion and AI. Gartner described a model that draws on data from across an organisation's attack surface and uses AI to improve prioritisation and analysis. "Tenable achieved its front-runner status in EAP by not only leveraging its long-standing dominance in vulnerability assessment but also combining its strong asset and attack surface discovery capabilities, support for third-party telemetry ingestion and AI. Tenable ingests asset and exposure data across the attack surface for cross-domain context beyond vulnerabilities and applies AI to enhance prioritisation, analyse attack paths and enable greater automation." Platform strategy Tenable said it has pursued an exposure management strategy that brings multiple forms of cyber risk into a single view. The company framed this as an AI-driven approach that unifies and contextualises risk exposure. Its Tenable One platform aggregates, normalises and connects asset, exposure and threat data. The company said the platform applies AI for prioritisation and threat analytics. It also provides remediation guidance. Gartner said Tenable aims to use a consolidated approach to exposure data to inform its AI analysis. It linked that approach to attack path analysis and a broader view of risk exposure. "Tenable is positioning its platform to become the pane of glass for all exposure data to better inform Tenable's AI. This will result in better analysis of attack paths and more comprehensive assessment of risk exposure to enable the orchestration of prioritised remediation workflows and mitigation actions." AI security Tenable also positioned its work around two related issues: the use of AI in cyber defence and the security of AI systems themselves. "As our world is increasingly shaped by AI, cybersecurity success belongs to organisations that proactively defend against threats at machine speed, rather than solely reacting to them," said Vlad Korsunsky, Chief Technology Officer, Tenable. "This approach requires organisations to master two sides of the AI coin: leveraging AI for defense and securing AI from threats. We're leading on both AI frontiers, helping organisations rapidly discover and close exposure gaps wherever they exist." The company said Tenable One includes what it describes as AI Exposure Management. It said this covers discovery, protection and governance for AI across enterprise environments. Tenable said this scope includes SaaS platforms, cloud services, APIs and agents. It also said the product gives security teams continuous visibility and risk-aware control. Gartner's assessment points to a broader shift in security tooling as vendors compete on how they ingest data and use AI to interpret it. Exposure assessment tools typically span vulnerability management, asset discovery, and risk prioritisation. Veprioritisation moved towards linking exposures to possible attack paths across hybrid environments. Tenable's recognition from Gartner arrives as security leaders evaluate how they govern AI use inside the organisation. Many organisations face new attack surfaces from AI services and integrations, alongside longstanding challenges in cloud and endpoint visibility. Tenable said it intends to continue developing its exposure management platform and its AI-driven approach to analysing risk and an organisation's attack surface.
