The company said Candon would lead international growth following what it described as a breakout year. Dropzone reported 11x annual recurring revenue growth, a USD $37 million Series B funding round led by Theory Ventures, and deployment by more than 300 enterprises. Candon joins from Cyware, where he served as Vice President International. Dropzone said he established EMEA and APAC operations at the cyber security firm as part of its global expansion. The company also cited senior leadership roles at Exabeam, Mimecast, and Imperva. Dropzone said Candon will report to Chief Revenue Officer Amit Patel. Second hire Dropzone also named Dan Bridges as Technical Director, International. The company said Bridges has nearly 30 years of cyber security experience. It cited his work leading the EMEA Security Solutioning team at Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Dropzone said Bridges will lead its technical go-to-market initiatives across international markets. Product focus Dropzone markets an "AI SOC analyst" for security operations centres. The company positions the product as software that carries out parts of security investigations. It framed the approach as a response to pressure on security teams and staffing constraints. The company said it already has customers in EMEA and APAC using the product in production. It listed Assala Energy, Awin, Infoguard, and Bolttech as examples. Dropzone said these organisations use the AI SOC analyst to autonomously investigate alerts and reduce mean time to resolution. Dropzone also cited a benchmark study by the Cloud Security Alliance with 148 participants. It said the study showed 22-29% better investigation accuracy and 45-61% faster completion times compared with manual analysis. International push The hiring comes as cyber security suppliers compete for budgets in a market shaped by incident-driven spending and growing regulatory requirements. Vendors have increasingly focused on automation claims in security operations as organisations try to manage higher alert volumes and a shortage of experienced staff. "Alert fatigue and analyst burnout are universal problems, and EMEA and APAC security teams face the same pressure to scale operations without scaling headcount," said Brett Candon, Vice President, International, Dropzone AI. "Dropzone's AI SOC analyst solves this by autonomously handling Tier 1 investigations with full transparency into its reasoning. That's what makes this different from previous automation approaches. Security teams get machine speed with analyst-level context, so they can make faster decisions and focus on higher-value work," said Candon. Dropzone said its platform integrates with existing security tools. It said the system performs end-to-end investigations in minutes. Dropzone said the product does not require playbooks, code, or prompts. The company said it hosts the AI SOC analyst within customers' dedicated instances. It also said the product is compliant with GDPR, NIS2, and EU AI Act regulations. Dropzone did not disclose revenue figures, regional headcount plans, or specific country priorities for the EMEA and APAC expansion. The company also did not provide a timeline for new office openings or additional senior hires. Candon said security teams in the regions face the same operational pressures as those in other markets, and he framed the role around scaling adoption of the company's product across international customers.
