News Even with the strongest defences in place, no organisation is immune to cyber incidents. The uncomfortable truth is this: it’s not a question of if you’ll be targeted, but when . That’s why resilience and recovery sit at the heart of a risk-based security strategy. Preventative controls are essential, but they only go so far. True resilience is about preparing for the worst – so when it happens, you can recover quickly, minimise disruption, and maintain the trust of your customers, stakeholders, and regulators. So, how does your organisation respond to an incident? Do you have a plan – and has it been tested? Why Resilience and Recovery Matter Every organisation has “crown jewels” – the critical assets, systems, and data that underpin business operations. Identifying these is only the first step. Once you know what matters most, you need to: Map vulnerabilities and understand how attackers could exploit them Prioritise controls to reduce risk Put clear response and recovery plans in place for when things go wrong This last step is often overlooked. Too many organisations have an incident response document sitting in a drawer that has never been tested, or recovery targets (RPOs and RTOs) that aren’t realistic. When an incident happens, those gaps become painfully clear. What Every Organisation Should Have in Place To build resilience and prepare for recovery, there are a few essentials: Incident Response Plan – A clear, accessible plan covering triage, escalation, team roles, and reporting lines. Playbooks – Practical recovery procedures for specific scenarios (e.g. ransomware, phishing, insider threat). Contact Directory – Up-to-date details for internal responders, executives, and critical suppliers/partners. Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) & Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) – Documented and prioritised to ensure recovery aligns with business needs. Exercises – Regular tabletop simulations and live tests to validate assumptions, reveal weaknesses, and build confidence in the plan. Tested, Not Just Written The difference between an organisation that weathers an incident and one that collapses under the pressure often comes down to preparation. A tested plan reduces downtime. A tested plan limits financial and reputational damage. A tested plan builds trust with customers, regulators, and partners. Without testing, an incident response plan is just words on paper. With testing, it becomes a proven playbook that your team can rely on when the pressure is highest.

The Question Every Business Leader Should Ask If a cyber incident happened today, how confident are you in your organisation’s ability to recover quickly? If the answer is anything less than “very confident,” now is the time to act. Building resilience takes foresight, structure, and practice – but it pays off when you need it most.

Too many organisations have an incident response document sitting in a drawer that has never been tested, or recovery targets (RPOs and RTOs) that aren’t realistic. When an incident happens, those gaps become painfully clear. What Every Organisation Should Have in Place To build resilience and prepare for recovery, there are a few essentials: Incident Response Plan – A clear, accessible plan covering triage, escalation, team roles, and reporting lines. Playbooks – Practical recovery procedures for specific scenarios (e.g. ransomware, phishing, insider threat). Contact Directory – Up-to-date details for internal responders, executives, and critical suppliers/partners. Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) & Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs) – Documented and prioritised to ensure recovery aligns with business needs. Exercises – Regular tabletop simulations and live tests to validate assumptions, reveal weaknesses, and build confidence in the plan. Tested, Not Just Written The difference between an organisation that weathers an incident and one that collapses under the pressure often comes down to preparation. A tested plan reduces downtime. A tested plan limits financial and reputational damage. A tested plan builds trust with customers, regulators, and partners. Without testing, an incident response plan is just words on paper. With testing, it becomes a proven playbook that your team can rely on when the pressure is highest.

Even with the strongest defences in place, no organisation is immune to cyber incidents. The uncomfortable truth is this: it’s not a question of if you’ll be targeted, but when . That’s why resilience and recovery sit at the heart of a risk-based security strategy. Preventative controls are essential, but they only go so far. True resilience is about preparing for the worst – so when it happens, you can recover quickly, minimise disruption, and maintain the trust of your customers, stakeholders, and regulators. So, how does your organisation respond to an incident? Do you have a plan – and has it been tested? Why Resilience and Recovery Matter Every organisation has “crown jewels” – the critical assets, systems, and data that underpin business operations. Identifying these is only the first step. Once you know what matters most, you need to: Map vulnerabilities and understand how attackers could exploit them Prioritise controls to reduce risk Put clear response and recovery plans in place for when things go wrong This last step is often overlooked.
