News You might assume everyone understands Cyber Essentials – but surprisingly, many don’t. In fact, only 12% of UK businesses and 15% of charities are aware of it. Even among IT professionals, 40% admit they aren’t familiar with the scheme. Let’s break down why Cyber Essentials isn’t just a checkbox, but a vital baseline in today’s cyber-first world. What is Cyber Essentials? Cyber Essentials is a UK government-backed certification managed by the NCSC and IASME. It’s not heavy-handed, but rather a practical framework built around five core technical controls : Boundary firewalls and internet gateways Secure configuration User access control Malware protection Patch management Achieving Cyber Essentials Plus adds a hands-on technical audit – testing those same controls in real systems. What’s New in 2025? Updates effective April 28, 2025 (v3.2 “Willow”) include: Passwordless authentication recognised alongside MFA. An expanded patching requirement: now you must apply all vulnerability fixes , not just high-risk patches. Reflects remote and hybrid working scenarios. Enhanced question wording and resource links for clarity. These enhancements make Cyber Essentials more relevant and current – reflecting today’s working environments and threat landscape. Why Does It Work? The Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2025 confirms: 43% of UK organisations experienced a breach in the past year. ( UK Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2025 reveals persistent threats in evolving digital landscape, bats for enhanced cyber resilience – Industrial Cyber ) Among those certified, 85 – 91% report improved awareness, risk understanding, and confidence. And with only approximately 31,000 out of 5 million UK businesses currently certified, adoption is low – but the potential impact is huge. Businesses certified under Cyber Essentials are: 92% less likely to make a cyber insurance claim. Saving 22 – 32% of time on cyber supply chain due diligence. Plus, nearly three-quarters say the framework boosted their overall security posture. Do You Need CE Before CE Plus? You don’t need basic CE first – you can apply for both at once. Many clients streamline their process with a combined assessment, covering the self-cert questionnaire and the technical audit simultaneously. What About Virtual Environments? Cyber Essentials applies to virtual machines, hypervisors, and any cloud-based infrastructure in scope. All controls – including patching, configuration, and network security – apply regardless of physical or virtual setup. So, Is It Worth It? Absolutely. Cyber Essentials is affordable , practical , and highly effective : Costs range from approximately £300 for Cyber Essentials to around £1,400 for Cyber Essentials Plus, depending on the size of your organisation.
