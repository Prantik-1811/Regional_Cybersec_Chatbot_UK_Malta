He will lead the company's engineering organisation and take responsibility for technology strategy. The company said Munasinghe has more than 15 years of experience leading global engineering organisations and delivering large-scale software platforms. One Identity said he will focus on innovation as customer security, operational, and deployment requirements change. Leadership remit One Identity positioned the appointment as part of a broader shift in how customers want to consume identity and security software. The company pointed to increased demand for fully managed software-as-a-service consumption models. One Identity said Munasinghe will set technology strategy. The role includes oversight of the engineering organisation. The company also described Munasinghe's background in scaling global engineering teams and modernising legacy platforms. It said he has held senior leadership roles at enterprise software firms, without naming the companies. Product direction One Identity develops identity security software. The company said it serves more than 11,000 organisations that manage over 500 million identities. It sells products in identity governance and administration, privileged access management, and access management. It also offers different deployment options, which range from self-managed to fully managed offerings. The company said Munasinghe's appointment reflects its focus on building and delivering software that aligns with customer expectations around reliability, scale, and security. Praerit Garg, CEO of One Identity, linked the appointment to product development and delivery. "Delighting customers starts with the products they rely on every day," said Praerit Garg, CEO, One Identity. "Gihan brings the right combination of technical depth, operational discipline, and customer-first thinking to help us continue innovating and evolving our core platforms, while accelerating our SaaS delivery model that customers increasingly demand. His leadership will be critical as we transform how we build, operate, and scale our technology." Customer expectations Munasinghe described the appointment as coming at a moment of change for the company and the market. He pointed to customer requirements around product reliability and ease of consumption. "This is a pivotal moment for One Identity and the identity security industry," said Munasinghe. "Customers expect products that are not only innovative, but also reliable, secure, and easy to consume. I look forward to working with the team to strengthen the products customers trust today, while delivering the quality, scale, and the innovation velocity their businesses demand for the future." One Identity said Munasinghe will prioritise customer needs as they evolve. The company said these needs include security, operational requirements, and deployment models. The appointment also sits alongside a wider industry push toward subscription software and managed services in security, where vendors aim to reduce operational burden for customers and standardise delivery. One Identity said Munasinghe will work on its software-as-a-service delivery model as demand increases. One Identity did not detail changes to its product roadmap. It did not disclose whether the role was newly created or whether Munasinghe replaced a predecessor. The company said Munasinghe will take on responsibility for building and scaling its technology as it develops its platforms and delivery models.
