Outcome-driven. What it means for security teams and IT leaders Learn more about our Google Cloud partnership… About Reliance Cyber LONDON – August 13, 2025 – Reliance Cyber today announced that it is an approved Google Security Operations Managed Security Services Provider (MSSP), following successful completion of a rigorous capability assessment. This designation builds on an established track record. Reliance Cyber has long supported organisations with the deployment and operation of Google Cloud’s security technologies — including Google Security Operations and , Google Threat Intelligence, — as part of its core managed service offering. The MSSP designation recognises that this delivery model meets Google Cloud’s highest standard for operational maturity, engineering depth, and customer impact. Mark Gascoigne, Managing Director at Reliance Cyber, said: “This designation recognises our strength in delivering the services our clients rely on day to day, our deep engagement with Google Cloud, and the outcomes we continue to achieve in complex environments” Alex Martin, Director of Cyber Services, added: “What sets us apart is how we operationalise Google Cloud’s tools — through a service model engineered to deliver resilience, speed, and measurable outcomes. That’s what we have proven through this assessment, and what we bring to every client engagement.” Engineering-led. Outcome-driven. Reliance Cyber is one of a select group of global partners to pass the MSSP assessment — which evaluates service architecture, security operations, integration maturity, customer success, and ongoing optimisation. This validation adds further assurance for organisations looking to adopt or expand their use of the Google Security Operations platform. Reliance Cyber is part of the GoogleSecurity Operations partner working group, and maintains. regular touchpoints with the Google Cloud team. This helps to ensure that clients benefit from early access to features, tightly aligned support, and input into product evolution. What it means for security teams and IT leaders Organisations already running Google Cloud security tools — or planning to — can work with Reliance Cyber as a trusted partner to deliver, manage, and continuously improve these services. This includes: 24/7 threat detection and response via a UK-based SOC Tuning and engineering of Google Security Operations rules and response playbooks Integration with Google Threat Intelligence for proactive risk reduction Support across vulnerability management, DFIR, and managed network security A service model designed for complex, real-world environments — not just ideal ones Learn more about our Google Cloud partnership… O ur Google Cloud partnership About Reliance Cyber At Reliance Cyber, we go beyond standard cybersecurity services, we become an extension of your team, working as a trusted partner to defend against the most advanced threats, including those at a nation-state level. Our approach is rooted in deep technical expertise, real-world threat intelligence, and a commitment to proactive security.
