SecurityBrief UK - Technology news for CISOs & cybersecurity decision-makers United Kingdom Guides # cloud security # cybersecurity # endpoint protection # firewalls # ransomware Search # Malware # Firewalls # Ransomware SonicWall firewalls strengthen security for IoT era Mon, 26th Jan 2026 By Tiju Cherian, Director, Product Management, SonicWall As IoT devices increase across networks, organizations need firewall-based controls to manage risk without sacrificing performance. The Internet of Things (IoT) is transforming industries with connected devices - from smart cameras and sensors to industrial controllers and healthcare monitors. While IoT delivers convenience and operational insights, it also expands your attack surface. Devices with minimal native security can become easy entry points for malware, ransomware, and unauthorized access. SonicWall firewalls provide the protection IoT environments need. By combining next-generation firewall (NGFW) technology, network segmentation and real-time threat intelligence, SonicWall secures IoT without compromising performance. The IoT Security Challenge IoT devices are diverse, often unmanaged, and frequently run outdated software. Many communicate over unencrypted channels, making them prime targets for attackers. Traditional perimeter defenses aren't enough - IoT security requires context-aware protection, segmentation, and real-time threat prevention. Why SonicWall Excels at IoT Protection 1. Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) Capabilities SonicWall NGFWs go beyond basic filtering. They inspect traffic at deeper layers and enforce policies based on applications, users, and behaviors. Key NGFW features for IoT security: Deep Packet Inspection (DPI): Detects hidden threats inside packet payloads, even in encrypted traffic. Intrusion Prevention System (IPS): Blocks exploits targeting IoT vulnerabilities. Reassembly-Free DPI (RFDPI): SonicWall's patented engine scans traffic in real time without slowing performance. 2. Network Segmentation and Zero Trust Containment is protection. SonicWall makes segmentation simple: Create dedicated VLANs or zones for IoT devices. Apply tailored access policies to restrict unnecessary communication. Implement Zero Trust principles to minimize lateral movement. 3. Integrated Threat Intelligence SonicWall firewalls leverage global threat intelligence for real-time updates: Automated signature distribution for emerging IoT threats. Behavioural analysis to detect zero-day attacks. 4. Advanced Security Services Add depth with SonicWall's security suite: Content Filtering and Application Control Capture ATP (sandboxing for zero-day threats) DNS Filtering and Anti-Malware 5. Visibility and Analytics Gain control with: Traffic monitoring and logging Dashboards and reports to identify anomalies and trends Fortifying IoT Devices with SonicWall IoT devices brings innovation, but also risk. SonicWall delivers defense-in-depth through NGFWs, segmentation, threat intelligence and advanced security services. With SonicWall, organizations can secure IoT networks while enabling growth and connectivity.
