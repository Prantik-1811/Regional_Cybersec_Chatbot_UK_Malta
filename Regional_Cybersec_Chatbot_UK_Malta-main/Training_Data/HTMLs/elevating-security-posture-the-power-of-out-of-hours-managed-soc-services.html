This gap in coverage poses a serious risk, as incidents can go undetected for hours, potentially leading to significant data breaches and financial losses. Additionally, the skills gap within internal security teams can be a hindrance. Cybersecurity experts are in high demand, and organisation may struggle to attract and retain top talent. Plus, an existing in-house team is already stretched to capacity . This shortage can limit the effectiveness of a security team, leaving organisations vulnerable to sophisticated attacks.
