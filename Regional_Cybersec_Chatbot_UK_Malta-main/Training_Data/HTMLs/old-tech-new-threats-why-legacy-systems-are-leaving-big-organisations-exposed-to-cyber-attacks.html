News From recent high-profile cyber attacks to growing regulatory scrutiny, one thing remains clear: organisations of all sizes are prime targets for cybercriminals. While large enterprises often make headlines, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) running outdated technology face equally serious risks. Despite their size, resources, and brand recognition, many face a hidden vulnerability putting them at serious risk – outdated technology. The Hidden Dangers of Legacy Infrastructure Legacy systems aren’t just inconvenient or slow; they are increasingly dangerous security liabilities. Unsupported operating systems, unpatched software, and vulnerable third-party applications create easy entry points for attackers. These outdated environments were not designed to withstand today’s sophisticated ransomware, supply chain attacks, or advanced persistent threats. Recent UK incidents highlight how legacy systems often serve as initial footholds for attackers, allowing lateral movement across networks. These range from outdated payroll and finance systems to decades-old internal applications that were never designed for exposure to external threats. It’s Not Just Big Organisations at Risk While large organisations attract the most media attention, cybercriminals do not discriminate by size. Small and medium-sized businesses often have less mature security programs, fewer dedicated resources, and may unknowingly run unsupported legacy systems – making them just as vulnerable, if not more so. Attackers frequently target SMBs as gateways to larger supply chains or to exploit weaker defences for financial gain. Every organisation running old or unpatched technology is at risk of breach, data loss, or disruption. Why Legacy Systems Persist Several factors keep old systems in play: Complexity: Large, distributed environments make upgrades daunting and risky. Cost: Modern platforms require significant investment, both financially and operationally. Interdependence: Legacy systems are often deeply embedded in business processes and connected across departments. While understandable, these reasons are no longer viable excuses for delaying modernisation – the risks now far outweigh the challenges. Patch Management: The Frontline Defence One of the most critical yet overlooked areas is patch management . Timely application of security patches is essential to prevent attackers exploiting known vulnerabilities – as recent events like the Microsoft SharePoint zero-day exploit have demonstrated. Legacy systems are often excluded from automated patching workflows or become impossible to patch due to end-of-life status. This creates dangerous blind spots in your security posture. A robust patch management strategy involves: Prioritising patches based on risk and system criticality Maintaining visibility over all systems, including legacy and shadow IT Testing patches carefully but swiftly to minimise exposure windows Employing compensating controls such as network segmentation or isolating vulnerable systems when patching isn’t possible It’s Not Just About New Tech – It’s About Smart Risk Management Modernisation doesn’t always mean ripping and replacing entire infrastructures. Instead, organisations should focus on: Network segmentation to contain breaches Prioritised patching of the highest-risk systems Gradual replacement of the most vulnerable legacy components Leveraging endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to monitor suspicious activity Above all, your people remain the most important defence layer. Phishing attacks continue to be the primary breach vector. Building a security-aware culture through continuous, scenario-driven training is non-negotiable. Regulatory Pressure and Cyber Hygiene Regulators worldwide are increasingly scrutinising how organisations manage legacy risks and patching processes. Failure to demonstrate effective patch management and risk mitigation can lead to hefty fines and reputational damage. Now Is the Time to Reassess If your organisation hasn’t reviewed its cyber resilience policies in the past year, now is the time to act. Key questions include: What legacy systems remain in operation, and what vulnerabilities do they expose? Are patching processes documented, audited, and enforced across the environment? Do employees receive regular, relevant cybersecurity awareness training? Is your incident response plan up to date and regularly tested? Do you have full visibility across people, process, and technology to identify weak spots? Cyber Resilience Checklist — What To Do Next: Audit Legacy Systems: Identify unsupported software, unpatched platforms, and systems needing urgent replacement or patching. Prioritise Patch Management: Develop a structured, risk-based approach to applying patches quickly and thoroughly. Review Cybersecurity Policies: Ensure policies reflect current threat landscapes and emphasise human risk factors like phishing. Run Awareness Training: Engage employees with practical, ongoing training to strengthen the human firewall. Test Defences: Use phishing simulations, penetration tests, and vulnerability scans to expose weaknesses. Update Incident Response Plans: Keep plans clear, comprehensive, and regularly rehearsed. Seek Expert Guidance: Third-party reviews can bring fresh perspectives and help prioritise actions. Staying Ahead of the Threat At CyberCrowd, we partner with organisations of all sizes to modernise cyber strategies – combining technology upgrades with smarter training, better policies, and expert advice that align people and systems for real resilience. If outdated technology or patch management concerns keep you awake at night, or you want to ensure your defences are battle-ready, get in touch for a cyber health check.

Legacy systems are often excluded from automated patching workflows or become impossible to patch due to end-of-life status. This creates dangerous blind spots in your security posture. A robust patch management strategy involves: Prioritising patches based on risk and system criticality Maintaining visibility over all systems, including legacy and shadow IT Testing patches carefully but swiftly to minimise exposure windows Employing compensating controls such as network segmentation or isolating vulnerable systems when patching isn’t possible It’s Not Just About New Tech – It’s About Smart Risk Management Modernisation doesn’t always mean ripping and replacing entire infrastructures. Instead, organisations should focus on: Network segmentation to contain breaches Prioritised patching of the highest-risk systems Gradual replacement of the most vulnerable legacy components Leveraging endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools to monitor suspicious activity Above all, your people remain the most important defence layer. Phishing attacks continue to be the primary breach vector. Building a security-aware culture through continuous, scenario-driven training is non-negotiable. Regulatory Pressure and Cyber Hygiene Regulators worldwide are increasingly scrutinising how organisations manage legacy risks and patching processes. Failure to demonstrate effective patch management and risk mitigation can lead to hefty fines and reputational damage. Now Is the Time to Reassess If your organisation hasn’t reviewed its cyber resilience policies in the past year, now is the time to act. Key questions include: What legacy systems remain in operation, and what vulnerabilities do they expose? Are patching processes documented, audited, and enforced across the environment? Do employees receive regular, relevant cybersecurity awareness training? Is your incident response plan up to date and regularly tested? Do you have full visibility across people, process, and technology to identify weak spots? Cyber Resilience Checklist — What To Do Next: Audit Legacy Systems: Identify unsupported software, unpatched platforms, and systems needing urgent replacement or patching. Prioritise Patch Management: Develop a structured, risk-based approach to applying patches quickly and thoroughly. Review Cybersecurity Policies: Ensure policies reflect current threat landscapes and emphasise human risk factors like phishing. Run Awareness Training: Engage employees with practical, ongoing training to strengthen the human firewall. Test Defences: Use phishing simulations, penetration tests, and vulnerability scans to expose weaknesses. Update Incident Response Plans: Keep plans clear, comprehensive, and regularly rehearsed. Seek Expert Guidance: Third-party reviews can bring fresh perspectives and help prioritise actions. Staying Ahead of the Threat At CyberCrowd, we partner with organisations of all sizes to modernise cyber strategies – combining technology upgrades with smarter training, better policies, and expert advice that align people and systems for real resilience. If outdated technology or patch management concerns keep you awake at night, or you want to ensure your defences are battle-ready, get in touch for a cyber health check.

While large enterprises often make headlines, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) running outdated technology face equally serious risks. Despite their size, resources, and brand recognition, many face a hidden vulnerability putting them at serious risk – outdated technology. The Hidden Dangers of Legacy Infrastructure Legacy systems aren’t just inconvenient or slow; they are increasingly dangerous security liabilities. Unsupported operating systems, unpatched software, and vulnerable third-party applications create easy entry points for attackers. These outdated environments were not designed to withstand today’s sophisticated ransomware, supply chain attacks, or advanced persistent threats. Recent UK incidents highlight how legacy systems often serve as initial footholds for attackers, allowing lateral movement across networks. These range from outdated payroll and finance systems to decades-old internal applications that were never designed for exposure to external threats. It’s Not Just Big Organisations at Risk While large organisations attract the most media attention, cybercriminals do not discriminate by size. Small and medium-sized businesses often have less mature security programs, fewer dedicated resources, and may unknowingly run unsupported legacy systems – making them just as vulnerable, if not more so. Attackers frequently target SMBs as gateways to larger supply chains or to exploit weaker defences for financial gain. Every organisation running old or unpatched technology is at risk of breach, data loss, or disruption. Why Legacy Systems Persist Several factors keep old systems in play: Complexity: Large, distributed environments make upgrades daunting and risky. Cost: Modern platforms require significant investment, both financially and operationally. Interdependence: Legacy systems are often deeply embedded in business processes and connected across departments. While understandable, these reasons are no longer viable excuses for delaying modernisation – the risks now far outweigh the challenges.
