SecurityBrief UK - Technology news for CISOs & cybersecurity decision-makers United Kingdom Guides # cloud security # cybersecurity # endpoint protection # firewalls # ransomware Search # SaaS # Digital Transformation # CX Pluralsight names Michael Ross as new Chief Product Officer Fri, 30th Jan 2026 By Catherine Knowles, News Editor Pluralsight has appointed Michael Ross as Chief Product Officer, adding a senior product executive as the company positions its platform for its next stage of development. Ross joins the technology skills and learning provider with responsibility for product leadership across the Pluralsight platform. The company said he will focus on innovation and on turning customer feedback into product enhancements. Erin Gajdalo, Chief Executive Officer of Pluralsight, said product direction will remain central as the business grows. "As Pluralsight enters its next phase of growth, strong product leadership is critical to turning our customers' feedback into valuable product enhancements that help them achieve strategic learning objectives," said Erin Gajdalo, CEO of Pluralsight. "Michael's track record of leading world-class product organizations and navigating complex change makes him the right leader for this moment. His perspective and leadership will play a key role as we continue to evolve our service and deliver greater value for our customers." Product remit Pluralsight sells subscriptions to a learning platform that focuses on technology roles and technical teams. The company positions the service around technology skill development across areas such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing, cybersecurity, software development and machine learning. The platform includes on-demand courses and other forms of training content. Pluralsight also offers skill assessments and hands-on learning formats alongside its library of courses, according to the company. Ross takes up the product brief at a time when many employers have increased spending scrutiny around learning and development. Training budgets face pressure in parts of the market, while technology leaders still report gaps in areas such as security, cloud operations and data skills. Vendors in the sector have responded with more measurement tools and role-based learning paths, alongside increased attention on AI-driven features and content refresh cycles. Pluralsight did not disclose whether the appointment links to any changes in product strategy or organisational structure. The company did not name Ross's predecessor in the Chief Product Officer role. Career background Ross brings 25 years of experience in product leadership at commercial software companies, according to Pluralsight. Before joining the company, he served as Chief Strategy and Product Officer at Trintech. Pluralsight said he led innovation initiatives there and worked on scaling the business through product transformation and acquisitions. Ross previously held senior roles at ECi Software Solutions and at Lakeview Technology, which now operates under the name Precisely. In his first public comments in the role, Ross described the appointment as a point of change for the company and framed his focus around product direction and customer outcomes. "This is a pivotal moment to join Pluralsight," said Ross. "The company has built a powerful learning solution, and the opportunity ahead is to translate that foundation into even clearer product focus and customer impact. I'm excited to partner across the business to deliver experiences that solve real customer challenges, scale with intention, and fuel long-term growth." Market landscape Pluralsight operates in a crowded market that ranges from broad corporate learning suites to specialist providers in software engineering and IT operations. Competition also includes internal training teams that build company-specific content and assessment processes. Technology skills platforms have placed more emphasis on content relevance and on proving skill progression. Some providers have expanded their use of assessments and practical labs as employers ask for stronger evidence of role readiness and compliance with security and operational requirements. Pluralsight said its content comes from vetted technology experts and that it serves companies, government organisations and individuals globally. The company is headquartered in Westlake, Texas, and it also has an office in Ireland. The company has not set out a timetable for new product initiatives under Ross's leadership, but the appointment indicates a renewed focus on product execution as Pluralsight moves into its next phase of growth.
