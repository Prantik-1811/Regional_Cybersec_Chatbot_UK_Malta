Stay DORA-Compliant CyberCrowd’s Expertise in Threat Led Penetration Testing (TLPT) What is DORA? The Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) is a new EU regulation aimed at ensuring financial institutions are resilient against cyber threats. One of DORA’s core requirements is that applicable organisations engage independent, specialised third-party firms to perform Threat Led Penetration Testing (TLPT) to identify, assess, and strengthen vulnerabilities. DORA’s Penetration Testing Requirement Under DORA, financial entities must only use penetration testing partners with specialised expertise in threat intelligence and red team testing. This ensures that testing simulates real-world cyber threats in a way that builds operational resilience and improves incident response capabilities. CyberCrowd’s pen testers bring the highest level of industry expertise and adhere to the specific TLPT requirements mandated by DORA, including: Unmatched Expertise: Our team has advanced technical and organisational capabilities, specialising in threat intelligence and threat-led penetration testing to accurately replicate the tactics used by real-world attackers. Certified Professionals: We work with accredited professionals who follow formal codes of conduct and ethical frameworks, ensuring industry-leading practices and upholding the integrity of your operations. Independent Assurance & Risk Management: We provide independent assurances and audit reports to manage risks associated with TLPT, protecting your organisation’s confidential data and safeguarding against business risks. Comprehensive Insurance Coverage: CyberCrowd maintains full professional indemnity insurance to cover against potential risks, misconduct, or negligence, giving you peace of mind throughout the testing process.

GET IN TOUCH WITH OUR TEAM DORA Compliance: Strengthening Your Security Posture Beyond the Basics While DORA emphasizes operational resilience, its requirements also present a strategic opportunity for financial institutions to elevate their entire cybersecurity posture. Threat Led Penetration Testing (TLPT) is more than a compliance box to check; it’s a proactive approach to embedding resilience deeply into your organisation’s digital infrastructure. Why TLPT Matters for Financial Institutions With cyber threats evolving daily, merely having cybersecurity measures in place is no longer enough. DORA’s focus on TLPT means your defences are continuously evaluated, tested, and strengthened against the tactics most likely to be used by attackers. This approach enables your team to better anticipate potential vulnerabilities and improve incident response.
