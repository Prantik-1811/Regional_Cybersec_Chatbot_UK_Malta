Reject All Save My Preferences Accept All Powered by Reject All Save My Preferences Accept All Case Study Beyond protection: The cybersecurity partnership powering RealVNC’s global growth Reliance Cyber - 17 April 2025 Estimated reading time: 6 minutes Contents Global reach, growing risk Setting the standard for managed security services Download the full case study About Reliance Cyber : Industry: Remote Access Software (SaaS) Solution: Managed Security Services (XDR) Objective: Support global operations, ensure compliance, and drive growth with always-on security. Global reach, growing risk RealVNC is a global leader in remote access software, with 250M+ downloads, 90,000 customers, and software running on over a billion devices. Their platform powers hybrid workforces across government, healthcare, education and more—making secure, reliable connectivity critical. However, that same connectivity brings risk. With internet-facing products deployed globally, security and compliance are non-negotiable. “Security is existential to us, If our product or operations were compromised, the impact would be irreparable. This is why security from the ground up is not just a claim—it’s a necessity.” said Andrew Woodhouse, CIO of RealVNC. A partnership built for scale To safeguard its infrastructure and support growth, RealVNC partnered with Reliance Cyber for always-on managed detection and response. Reliance Cyber’s XDR service delivers 24/7/365 monitoring, threat mitigation, and compliance support—allowing RealVNC to focus on innovation and product development. “We want our product to be accessible to everyone. Reliance Cyber’s services underpin this by ensuring that the infrastructure we provide is secure, reliable, and capable of supporting diverse needs.” — Andrew Woodhouse The partnership was recognised at the SC Awards 2024, where RealVNC and Reliance Cyber were jointly shortlisted for Best Managed Security Service, alongside CrowdStrike and Sophos. Security as a Business Enabler For RealVNC, security is more than protection—it’s a strategic advantage. In highly regulated sectors like government and healthcare, proving strong security and compliance is essential to securing contracts and building trust. Reliance Cyber’s expert team—backed by an SC-cleared SOC and advanced threat intelligence—simplifies compliance, helping RealVNC accelerate deal cycles and expand globally. “Reliance Cyber’s expertise helps us navigate the complex regulatory landscape with ease. This not only reassures our existing clients but also significantly strengthens our position in proposals for new business.” — Andrew Woodhouse Going further: proactive, embedded Security In addition to XDR, RealVNC embeds security deeply into its operations: Monthly external vulnerability scans across all infrastructure Source code composition analysis to reduce supply chain risk Regular whitebox audits by a trusted security partner “A key area we consistently win against our competitors is security. Reliance Cyber enables us to lead with this in our proposals, turning our security posture into a major selling point. It’s helping us win significantly more business.” — Andrew Woodhouse More than a provider: A strategic extension of the team Reliance Cyber operates as a true partner—integrated into RealVNC’s team and strategy. Board-Level Engagement: Reliance Cyber leadership participates in Quarterly Business Reviews, aligning security with growth and compliance goals. Dedicated Support: RealVNC benefits from a consistent technical team that translates business needs into proactive security measures. Expert Augmentation: Reliance Cyber brings insight from a broad customer base, helping RealVNC stay ahead of evolving threats. “The depth of support we get from Reliance Cyber is unlike anything we have experienced before. Security isn’t just a service for them, it’s a true partnership. Having direct access to their leadership, technical experts, and dedicated team means we are not just reacting to threats, but staying ahead of them. Their ability to align security with our business goals—especially as we expand into new territories—takes the pressure off our internal teams, allowing us to focus on growth and innovation with confidence.” — Andrew Woodhouse Faster time to value, smarter spend Reliance Cyber’s advanced automation allows for near-instant threat detection, accelerated response, and rapid deployment—turning what used to take weeks into minutes. And by outsourcing, RealVNC avoids the significant costs of building an in-house SOC. “To build everything in-house would take years and significant investment. With Reliance Cyber, we were operational quickly, without any financial surprises or unnecessary overheads.” — Andrew Woodhouse “Investing in security isn’t simply a cost, it’s a business enabler. Reliance Cyber’s services allow us to focus on our strategic goals while meeting and exceeding client expectations. Their impact on our bottom line has been significant.” — Andrew Woodhouse Recognition and Results Being shortlisted alongside global cybersecurity leaders at the SC Awards 2024 highlights the strength of the RealVNC–Reliance Cyber partnership. “Security has always been in RealVNC’s DNA, and Reliance Cyber has helped us take that commitment to the next level. They are an invaluable partner, ensuring our security is not just a protective measure but a competitive advantage.” — Andrew Woodhouse CONCLUSION Setting the standard for managed security services By embedding security into its growth strategy, RealVNC has turned cybersecurity into a powerful enabler. With Reliance Cyber as its strategic partner, RealVNC is scaling globally with confidence—supported by world-class security, regulatory assurance, and predictable costs.
