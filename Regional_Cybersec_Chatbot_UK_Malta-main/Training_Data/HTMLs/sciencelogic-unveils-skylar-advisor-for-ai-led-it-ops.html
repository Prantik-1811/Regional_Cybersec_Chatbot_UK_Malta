IT Brief US - Technology news for CIOs & IT decision-makers United States Guides # artificial intelligence # digital transformation # disaster recovery # hybrid & remote work # internet of things Search # DevOps # Hybrid Cloud # Digital Transformation ScienceLogic unveils Skylar Advisor for AI-led IT ops Fri, 6th Feb 2026 (Today) By Kaleah Salmon, News Editor ScienceLogic has launched Skylar Advisor, which it describes as an AI-native advisor for IT operations. It positions the release as a step beyond chat-based assistants, offering software that surfaces guidance without requiring prompts. The launch comes as IT teams manage growing volumes of telemetry, alerts, tickets and documentation across multiple tools. Many organisations have turned to automation and AIOps platforms for relief, but concerns remain about accuracy, explainability and trust when AI is used in day-to-day operations. Skylar Advisor combines real-time observability data with ScienceLogic's customer-owned knowledge. It produces recommendations that users can review against the underlying data and documentation, and it is designed to provide traceability for its guidance. Operational focus Traditional monitoring and AIOps tools collect and correlate signals, but human operators still decide what matters most and what to do next. ScienceLogic presents Skylar Advisor as reducing the work of stitching together alerts and tickets, relying on informal "tribal knowledge" held by experienced staff. Skylar Advisor adds an operating model in which the software prioritises actions and surfaces insights. It continuously reasons across telemetry, topology, and historical data, and generates plain-language issue descriptions for different audiences. "IT teams are drowning in data but starving for insight," said Dave Link, CEO and co-founder of ScienceLogic. "Skylar Advisor applies AI reasoning directly to operational reality - not abstract prompts or generic models. It automates the analysis and guidance that once depended on human intuition. This helps organisations act faster, reduce risk, and innovate with confidence." Product components ScienceLogic has positioned Skylar Advisor within its ScienceLogic AI Platform. The platform also includes Skylar One (formerly SL1), along with Skylar Automation, Skylar Compliance, and Skylar Analytics. Skylar Advisor includes several elements aimed at different stages of incident investigation and operational decision-making. Advisories are intended to identify and summarise critical problems within large volumes of events. Ask Skylar provides a conversational interface for answering questions based on enterprise knowledge, according to ScienceLogic. It also includes a Persona Wizard that adjusts the tone, depth, and format of guidance based on the user's role, tailoring outputs for L1 engineers, SREs, and executives. Another element, Knowledge Corpus, is designed to unify telemetry with trusted knowledge sources under governance and control. Automatic Knowledge Generation captures investigation steps and verified fixes, enabling teams to reuse them later as knowledge-base content. ScienceLogic also says Skylar Advisor provides "verifiable insights" by citing the specific data and documents that inform each recommendation. MSP angle ScienceLogic has also positioned Skylar Advisor as relevant for managed service providers, highlighting onboarding, multi-tenant operations, and automation for alerting and reporting. It also links the release to changes in service providers' operating economics, including margins and revenue. Multi-tenant environments can add complexity for service providers, which must maintain separation between customers while keeping consistent operational processes. Tools that capture and reuse operational knowledge can also be important for MSPs, where staff turnover and skill-level variation can pose risks to service quality. "As IT environments continue to scale, relying on people to manually connect alerts, tickets, and documentation doesn't work," said Michael Nappi, Chief Product Officer at ScienceLogic. "Skylar Advisor automates how operational knowledge is captured, interpreted, and applied, helping teams move faster and make better decisions without adding risk." ScienceLogic says Skylar Advisor is deployable anywhere and uses a knowledge-centric architecture. It also describes the product as using agentic orchestration alongside automated knowledge capture and retrieval, linking these choices to accuracy and traceability in operational settings. Founded in 2003, ScienceLogic sells software used by enterprises, service providers and government agencies. The company says it is recognised as a leader in The Forrester Wave: AIOps Platforms and as a visionary in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Observability Platforms. Skylar Advisor is now available as part of the ScienceLogic AI Platform. ScienceLogic positions it as a core intelligence component alongside its observability, automation, compliance and analytics products.
