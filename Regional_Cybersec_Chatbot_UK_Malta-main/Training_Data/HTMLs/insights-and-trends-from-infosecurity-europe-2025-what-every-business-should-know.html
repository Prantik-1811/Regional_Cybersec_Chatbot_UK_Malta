News Last week, members of the CyberCrowd team spent a dynamic few days at InfoSec 2025, one of the UK’s largest cybersecurity events. It was a fantastic opportunity to soak up the latest industry insights, spot emerging trends, and engage with security professionals from across sectors. Here’s a digest of what stood out – insights that can help your business stay ahead in today’s rapidly evolving cyber landscape. Cybersecurity Is Getting Smarter – But So Are Attackers One clear takeaway from InfoSec: artificial intelligence (AI) is being integrated into almost every corner of cybersecurity, from threat detection to incident response. Vendors and experts alike highlighted how AI can enhance defence capabilities by identifying subtle threat patterns that traditional tools might miss. But here’s the flip side – attackers are also leveraging AI, using it to craft more sophisticated attacks that can bypass conventional safeguards. This means businesses need to continuously evolve their security approaches, staying proactive and informed rather than reactive. The Rise of Offensive-Driven Defence and Context-Aware Pen Testing A particularly compelling session explored “offensive-driven defence,” where penetration testing goes beyond ticking boxes. Instead of just identifying isolated vulnerabilities, modern approaches focus on understanding how seemingly low-risk issues can be chained together by attackers to gain full access. Why does this matter? Many traditional vulnerability scans highlight CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) based on severity scores, but savvy attackers link lower-risk weaknesses in creative ways that automated scans often overlook. For businesses, this means your cybersecurity assessments should consider the bigger picture – looking at how vulnerabilities interact, not just what each one is in isolation. Cyber Resilience Starts with Ownership and Clarity An important theme throughout InfoSec was the need for clear ownership within organisations – someone accountable for protecting data and driving cybersecurity initiatives. It’s no longer just about IT teams; executives and business leaders must be engaged and informed to build true resilience. Cloud security was also a hot topic, with consensus that while cloud environments offer many benefits, they require proper governance and security practices to avoid common pitfalls. Third-Party Risk Management Is Essential – and Becoming Mandatory Regulations and frameworks like DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) are pushing businesses to take third-party risk seriously. Assessing the security posture of suppliers, partners, and service providers is no longer optional but a vital part of any robust cyber strategy. Tools that simplify third-party risk assessments were popular, and businesses that proactively manage these risks reduce their exposure to breaches originating from external partners. Practical Takeaways for Your Business Embrace context-aware security: Don’t just rely on vulnerability scores or automated scans – seek security partners who understand how risks interconnect and evolve. Invest in clear ownership: Make sure your organisation designates responsibility for cybersecurity at a senior level, ensuring coordinated efforts across teams. Manage third-party risks: Start or deepen your supplier security assessments to meet regulatory requirements and reduce hidden vulnerabilities. Stay informed on AI trends: Both defensive and offensive AI are shaping the threat landscape – keep learning and adapt your defences accordingly. What’s Next for Your Cybersecurity? InfoSec London 2025 was a reminder that cybersecurity is a constantly shifting arena. Businesses that stay curious, agile, and proactive will be best positioned to navigate this landscape safely. If you’d like to explore how these insights could impact your organisation or discuss ways to strengthen your cyber resilience, get in touch with our team at CyberCrowd. We’re here to help you stay secure – today and tomorrow.

For businesses, this means your cybersecurity assessments should consider the bigger picture – looking at how vulnerabilities interact, not just what each one is in isolation. Cyber Resilience Starts with Ownership and Clarity An important theme throughout InfoSec was the need for clear ownership within organisations – someone accountable for protecting data and driving cybersecurity initiatives. It’s no longer just about IT teams; executives and business leaders must be engaged and informed to build true resilience. Cloud security was also a hot topic, with consensus that while cloud environments offer many benefits, they require proper governance and security practices to avoid common pitfalls. Third-Party Risk Management Is Essential – and Becoming Mandatory Regulations and frameworks like DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) are pushing businesses to take third-party risk seriously. Assessing the security posture of suppliers, partners, and service providers is no longer optional but a vital part of any robust cyber strategy. Tools that simplify third-party risk assessments were popular, and businesses that proactively manage these risks reduce their exposure to breaches originating from external partners. Practical Takeaways for Your Business Embrace context-aware security: Don’t just rely on vulnerability scores or automated scans – seek security partners who understand how risks interconnect and evolve. Invest in clear ownership: Make sure your organisation designates responsibility for cybersecurity at a senior level, ensuring coordinated efforts across teams. Manage third-party risks: Start or deepen your supplier security assessments to meet regulatory requirements and reduce hidden vulnerabilities. Stay informed on AI trends: Both defensive and offensive AI are shaping the threat landscape – keep learning and adapt your defences accordingly. What’s Next for Your Cybersecurity? InfoSec London 2025 was a reminder that cybersecurity is a constantly shifting arena. Businesses that stay curious, agile, and proactive will be best positioned to navigate this landscape safely.

We’re here to help you stay secure – today and tomorrow. Last week, members of the CyberCrowd team spent a dynamic few days at InfoSec 2025, one of the UK’s largest cybersecurity events. It was a fantastic opportunity to soak up the latest industry insights, spot emerging trends, and engage with security professionals from across sectors. Here’s a digest of what stood out – insights that can help your business stay ahead in today’s rapidly evolving cyber landscape. Cybersecurity Is Getting Smarter – But So Are Attackers One clear takeaway from InfoSec: artificial intelligence (AI) is being integrated into almost every corner of cybersecurity, from threat detection to incident response. Vendors and experts alike highlighted how AI can enhance defence capabilities by identifying subtle threat patterns that traditional tools might miss. But here’s the flip side – attackers are also leveraging AI, using it to craft more sophisticated attacks that can bypass conventional safeguards. This means businesses need to continuously evolve their security approaches, staying proactive and informed rather than reactive. The Rise of Offensive-Driven Defence and Context-Aware Pen Testing A particularly compelling session explored “offensive-driven defence,” where penetration testing goes beyond ticking boxes. Instead of just identifying isolated vulnerabilities, modern approaches focus on understanding how seemingly low-risk issues can be chained together by attackers to gain full access. Why does this matter? Many traditional vulnerability scans highlight CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) based on severity scores, but savvy attackers link lower-risk weaknesses in creative ways that automated scans often overlook. For businesses, this means your cybersecurity assessments should consider the bigger picture – looking at how vulnerabilities interact, not just what each one is in isolation.
