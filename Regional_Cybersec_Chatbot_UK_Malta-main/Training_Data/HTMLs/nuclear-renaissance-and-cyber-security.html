This article explores the cybersecurity challenges associated with Small Modular Reactors (SMRs). There are over 80 SMR designs in development across 18 countries, with about ten designs approaching real-life deployments. The promise of SMRs is to miniaturise and industrialise the deployment of the mini-nuclear reactors with minimal service requirements and a lifespan of 60-80 years. SMRs are promised to be inherently safer than traditional reactors. This article explores the role of cybersecurity in modernised nuclear and SMRs.
