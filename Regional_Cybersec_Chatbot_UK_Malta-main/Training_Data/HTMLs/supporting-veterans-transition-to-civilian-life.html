Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Supporting Veterans Transition to Civilian Life As a veteran-owned and operated company, CYSIAM understands the importance of supporting those who have served in the military and their transition into civilian life. That's why we are proud to partner with TechVets, an organisation that helps veterans and service leavers find employment in the technology industry. In a recent LinkedIn post, we shared a video that discusses the positive impact that veterans can have on a company's culture. We believe that employing veterans not only helps individuals transition into civilian life, but also brings valuable skills and experiences to the workplace. At CYSIAM, we have seen first-hand the benefits of hiring veterans. We have found that veterans possess a unique set of skills, such as adaptability, problem-solving, and leadership, that are essential in the technology industry. Furthermore, veterans often have a strong work ethic and a commitment to teamwork that can help foster a positive and productive work environment. We encourage other organisations to pledge their commitment to supporting veterans by signing up to the Armed Forces Covenant. This pledge demonstrates a commitment to supporting veterans and their families and can lead to a more diverse and inclusive workplace. We want to thank TechVets for the opportunity to share our experience in employing veterans, and for their ongoing work to support veterans in the technology industry. We encourage everyone to watch the video to learn more about the positive impact that veterans can have on a company's culture. At CYSIAM, we are committed to supporting veterans and their transition into civilian life, and we hope that other organisations will join us in this important effort.
