Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) CTI as-a-Service (CTIaaS) We provide proactive support to Clients, helping them better understand threats, enrich security data, & contextualise security events. A force-multiplier for your security. Our Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP) provides ‘push’ and ‘on-demand’ access to a broad range of data, collated and curated from commercial and open-source feeds, dark web monitoring, and social media. This is in addition to our own proprietary threat intelligence sources and identifies the latest Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs), and malware. Via a secure web-based client portal, we provide regular tailored threat reports and advisories based on your specific needs, technology profile, and industry sector, as well as an on-demand Request For Information (RFI) service to your security analysts, including Malware Analysis. Speak to us Our Approach CYSIAM’s team of experienced threat analysts conducts independent research and analysis of commercial, closed, and open-source data in line with our clients’ Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs) defined during onboarding and regularly reviewed. We have access to a significant number of threat feeds and Malware Information Sharing Platforms (MISPs), including that of the globally-recognised Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), of which CYSIAM is a Full Member. This information is collated and curated in our own MISP and TIP and accessed by our clients via a secure client portal. This client portal allows our clients to create and track tickets or RFIs, access client-specific and general reports and threat advisories, and access / query the CYSIAM MISP. Benefits Proactive Detection & Prevention: CTIaaS enables organisations to stay ahead of cyber threats by providing real-time intelligence on emerging tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by attackers. This proactive approach helps prevent breaches before they occur, rather than reacting after the fact. Efficiency & Optimisation: By outsourcing threat intelligence to specialised providers, organisations can access high-quality, up-to-date threat data without the need to build and maintain expensive in-house intelligence teams or infrastructure. This reduces costs and allows internal teams to focus on core security functions. Enhanced Decision-Making: CTIaaS delivers actionable insights tailored to an organisation’s industry, technology stack, and threat landscape. These insights support faster, more informed decision-making during incident response and improve overall security posture through better risk prioritisation. Improved Collaboration: We aggregate intelligence from sources across critical industries and high-threat geographies. This contextualised and rich intelligence helps clients mitigate the risk of threats that may not yet have affected their own networks, enabling more comprehensive and timely defence.

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Threat Modelling & Assessment We help clients understand the threats they face in the environment they operate in, the organisations they work with, & the technology they use. The foundation of effective cyber resilience. Understanding the threats you face is a fundamental step towards designing, implementing, and testing an effective security solution. CYSIAM's Threat Modelling methodology maps out how your organisation looks from the outside, but also where you may be vulnerable from within. An external threat could be identified due to the work you do or who you do it for, or if you work in a country of interest to a hostile state threat actor. Internal threats are much harder to foresee, but must be considered in order to prepare effective mitigation strategies. Threats can also be associated with the technology you use, which may well be critical to your operations. Knowing what to protect and it what circumstances it could be compromised will inform your protection and detection capabilities, allow you to exercise your incident response plans in appropriate scenarios, and provide critical information to responders should the worst happen. Our Approach CYSIAM Threat Modelling begins with defining the scope and understanding the system architecture, including assets, data flows, and trust boundaries. By decomposing the system into components, our team will identify potential attack surfaces and classify threats using structured frameworks (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK). This helps uncover vulnerabilities such as spoofing, information leakage, or privilege escalation, which may not be obvious during standard development or operational reviews. The findings are then documented in a threat model report, reviewed with stakeholders, and used to guide development or system improvements. Threat modelling is not a one-time task but should be continuously updated as systems evolve or new threats emerge, ensuring ongoing resilience and risk awareness. All CYSIAM Managed Detection & Response (MDR) service engagements begin with an appropriate level of Threat Modelling. Benefits Threat modelling offers several key benefits that enhance the security and resilience of organisations, especially when integrated early in the design of security and incident response strategies: Proactive Risk Identification: It helps teams identify potential threats and vulnerabilities before they are exploited, allowing for preventive action rather than reactive patching after an incident. Cross-Team Collaboration: It encourages communication between information technology and security teams, and business stakeholders, fostering a shared understanding of risks and responsibilities. Regulatory and Compliance: Many standards (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST, GDPR) encourage or require risk assessments — threat modelling provides a structured way to demonstrate due diligence. Continuous Security Awareness: Regular threat modelling keeps teams engaged with evolving threats and ensures security remains a part of ongoing system maintenance and evolution.

Knowing what to protect and it what circumstances it could be compromised will inform your protection and detection capabilities, allow you to exercise your incident response plans in appropriate scenarios, and provide critical information to responders should the worst happen. The foundation of effective cyber resilience. Understanding the threats you face is a fundamental step towards designing, implementing, and testing an effective security solution. CYSIAM's Threat Modelling methodology maps out how your organisation looks from the outside, but also where you may be vulnerable from within. An external threat could be identified due to the work you do or who you do it for, or if you work in a country of interest to a hostile state threat actor.

Our Approach CYSIAM Threat Modelling begins with defining the scope and understanding the system architecture, including assets, data flows, and trust boundaries. By decomposing the system into components, our team will identify potential attack surfaces and classify threats using structured frameworks (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK). This helps uncover vulnerabilities such as spoofing, information leakage, or privilege escalation, which may not be obvious during standard development or operational reviews. The findings are then documented in a threat model report, reviewed with stakeholders, and used to guide development or system improvements. Threat modelling is not a one-time task but should be continuously updated as systems evolve or new threats emerge, ensuring ongoing resilience and risk awareness. All CYSIAM Managed Detection & Response (MDR) service engagements begin with an appropriate level of Threat Modelling.

Benefits Threat modelling offers several key benefits that enhance the security and resilience of organisations, especially when integrated early in the design of security and incident response strategies: Proactive Risk Identification: It helps teams identify potential threats and vulnerabilities before they are exploited, allowing for preventive action rather than reactive patching after an incident. Cross-Team Collaboration: It encourages communication between information technology and security teams, and business stakeholders, fostering a shared understanding of risks and responsibilities. Regulatory and Compliance: Many standards (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST, GDPR) encourage or require risk assessments — threat modelling provides a structured way to demonstrate due diligence. Continuous Security Awareness: Regular threat modelling keeps teams engaged with evolving threats and ensures security remains a part of ongoing system maintenance and evolution.

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Managed Detection & Response (MDR) Threat Hunting Our team is relentless in finding the stealthiest & most sophisticated threats that pose the highest risk to our clients’ critical operations. Exposing advanced & novel threats. CYSIAM's Threat Hunting capability is a proactive security approach that involves the identification and mitigation of persistent threats and other cyber-attacks. Traditional security monitoring tools and techniques may not be enough to detect and respond to these sophisticated threats, which can blend in silently and lead to a breach if they remain undetected. That's where CYSIAM's expert threat hunters come in. This is an advanced form of investigation as it is primarily concerned with finding threats that normal detection methods can’t find; behavioural evidence based on the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of advanced threat actors. Speak to us Our Approach CYSIAM takes a proactive approach to identifying malicious activity and persistent threat hunting performed by skilled analysts is one of the most successful forms of detection. Threat hunting uses the threat model of an organisation and technical threat intelligence to hypothesise how potential attacks would manifest on a network, and then carry out an investigation or ‘hunt’ for that threat. Within the CYSIAM, threat hunting is not a one-time event but rather a continuous process that requires vigilance and expertise. Once we have established the main details for your enterprise environment and sector, we will use our threat intelligence team to build a profile of adversaries, their preferred TTPs and Infrastructure, and then build a working hypothesis for our investigation(s). Our threat hunting capability both supports, and is supported by, our Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) team and our 24x7 UK-based Security Operations Centre (SOC). Benefits Early Detection of Threats: By proactively hunting for threats, we identify potential security incidents earlier, reducing the risk of damage to the organisation. Improved Response Times: We ensure that our clients respond quickly to emerging threats and reduce the impact of security incidents. Enhanced Security Posture: By identifying and mitigating threats, we help our clients improve their overall security posture and reduce the risk of future cyber-attacks. Reduce Incident impact: Early detection and response to security incidents can reduce downtime and financial loss associated with cyber-attacks.

Traditional security monitoring tools and techniques may not be enough to detect and respond to these sophisticated threats, which can blend in silently and lead to a breach if they remain undetected. That's where CYSIAM's expert threat hunters come in. This is an advanced form of investigation as it is primarily concerned with finding threats that normal detection methods can’t find; behavioural evidence based on the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) of advanced threat actors.

Our Approach CYSIAM takes a proactive approach to identifying malicious activity and persistent threat hunting performed by skilled analysts is one of the most successful forms of detection. Threat hunting uses the threat model of an organisation and technical threat intelligence to hypothesise how potential attacks would manifest on a network, and then carry out an investigation or ‘hunt’ for that threat. Within the CYSIAM, threat hunting is not a one-time event but rather a continuous process that requires vigilance and expertise. Once we have established the main details for your enterprise environment and sector, we will use our threat intelligence team to build a profile of adversaries, their preferred TTPs and Infrastructure, and then build a working hypothesis for our investigation(s). Our threat hunting capability both supports, and is supported by, our Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) team and our 24x7 UK-based Security Operations Centre (SOC).

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Incident Response Cyber Incident Readiness Review (CIRR) We baseline an organisation's ability to withstand & recover from a serious cyber attack, providing actionable recommendations for improvement. Communicate & mitigate risk. A Cyber Incident Readiness Review (IRR) assesses your organisation’s ability to detect and respond to a cyber security incident. We examine not only your incident response capability, but also threat and event management, and business continuity. CIRR is an effective way for Technical teams to articulate to non-technical C-Suite stakeholders the risk they are ultimately accountable for. We explain the consequences of identified gaps in a non-technical language, providing actionable and proportionate recommendations as to remediation. Speak to us Our Approach We conduct a systematic evaluation of your preparedness to detect, respond to, and recover from cyber security incidents. The first step is to assess existing policies and procedures to ensure they are comprehensive and up-to-date with the latest threats and regulatory requirements. This includes reviewing the incident response plan, communication strategies, and the roles and responsibilities assigned during a cyber incident. Next, we test the organisation's readiness through simulations and drills. These activities help to uncover gaps in the incident response process and evaluate the effectiveness of communication channels, both internally and with external stakeholders such as regulators and law enforcement agencies. By systematically addressing these areas, an organisation can enhance its resilience against cyber threats and minimise the potential impact of security breaches. Benefits Enhanced Incident Preparedness: We help you identify gaps in your current cyber response plans, ensuring you are well-prepared to handle real-world incidents effectively and minimise disruption. Tailored Risk Mitigation: Reviews are customised to the specific needs and threat landscape of your organisation, allowing for more targeted recommendations to reduce cyber risk. Regulatory and Compliance Assurance: By aligning with key standards such as the NCSC’s guidance and GDPR requirements, we support you in meeting regulatory obligations and avoiding potential penalties.

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Incident Response Cyber Incident Exercise (CIE) We bring together technical & non-technical stakeholders to practice executing crisis planning, and identify areas for improvement. Practice makes perfect...or at least better. Cyber Incident Exercises (CIE), either Table-top or Live-play, are a vital component of any organisation’s cybersecurity strategy, enabling teams to rehearse their response to realistic threat scenarios in a controlled environment. These exercises test the effectiveness of incident response plans, improve coordination between technical and non-technical staff, and help identify weaknesses before a real incident occurs. By simulating cyber attacks such as ransomware, data breaches, or phishing campaigns, organisations can refine their decision-making processes, clarify roles and responsibilities, and build confidence across all levels of the business. Regular CIEs not only enhance operational readiness but also demonstrate a proactive approach to cyber resilience, which is increasingly valued by regulators, insurers, and stakeholders alike. Our Approach CYSIAM adopts a comprehensive, intelligence-led approach to Cyber Incident Exercising (CIE), tailored to bolster your organisation's resilience against cyber threats. As an NCSC Assured Service Provider for CIE, we deliver both discussion-based tabletop exercises and dynamic live-play simulations, designed to rigorously test and enhance incident response capabilities. These exercises are crafted to reflect real-world attack scenarios, enabling organisations to evaluate their preparedness, identify vulnerabilities, and refine their response strategies in a controlled environment. By simulating incidents such as ransomware attacks or data breaches, CYSIAM ensures that both technical teams and executive leadership are equipped to act decisively during actual cyber crises. CYSIAM’s exercises are informed by current threat intelligence, ensuring relevance to the specific risks faced by your organisation. Post-exercise reviews provide actionable insights, facilitating the enhancement of incident response plans and contributing to a culture of continuous improvement. Benefits Improved Response Readiness: CIEs prepare teams to act swiftly and effectively during a real cyber incident by rehearsing roles, responsibilities, and decision-making under pressure. Identification of Gaps and Weaknesses: These exercises reveal shortcomings in existing policies, procedures, and technical controls, allowing organisations to address them before a real attack occurs. Enhanced Cross-Team Coordination: CIEs promote collaboration between IT, legal, communications, and executive teams, ensuring a unified and coherent response during a cyber crisis. Increased Stakeholder Confidence: Demonstrating preparedness through regular exercises reassures clients, regulators, and insurers that the organisation takes cyber resilience seriously.

Risk Assessment and Maturity Framework. We assess your organisation against combined international standards, providing detailed metrics on your current risk profile and level of maturity. Our consultants help you to identify critical weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers, whilst our bespoke platform generates detailed reports with actionable recommendations. Our framework is divided into the following seven areas, and whilst budgets or time may constrain the depth to which we examine an organisation, we never compromise on the breadth of our review. Governance Policy, process & procedure Technology Data handling Culture & education Physical environment Supply chain Governance Cyber-risk should be treated like any other business risk and should have board level ownership. This review will evaluate the approach to cyber-risk, how it defines roles and responsibilities, and if critical business dependencies have been identified along with the threats posed to them. Policy, process & procedure Appropriate documentation and working practices provide the necessary underlying foundation on which the correct business decisions can be made, whilst demonstrating compliance to relevant legislation and standards. Our review will evaluate existing policies and identify gaps in documentation and working practices that can be addressed to reduce cyber-risk. Technology Technology should comply with, and support, the security policies of an organisation. ICT teams (internal or outsourced) are usually focused on maintaining availability of the technology's functionality, and this can lead to mismanagement of technical security controls. We assess the 'real-life' approach against policies to identify any gaps (vulnerabilities). To this end, we can conduct vulnerability scans of the organisation's external and internal network and devices as part of a policy compliance assessment. Data handling Understanding the data that is processed is crucial not only for establishing and implementing the correct security controls, but also for legal compliance (GDPR). This review will confirm whether an organisation has identified the data it processes, transmits, and stores, and whether it has the necessary security in place to protect it. Culture & education People can be a critical weakness in cyber security but also a key aspect of defence. Understanding levels of awareness within an organisation and its workforce helps to identify areas of strengths and weakness and where to focus programmes of improvement. Culture plays an important role in the security of an organisation and our assessment will evaluate if cyber security awareness and understanding is embedded at all levels. Physical environment We look here at how physical access to an organisations ICT infrastructure is controlled, from server rooms to network access points to individual devices. Often the simplest method of attack is best and stealing or cloning an employee's door pass can gain vital access to sensitive areas of buildings. This is where digital and physical risks overlap, and we always advocate a holistic view of security. Supply chain Critical suppliers and third parties can introduce vulnerabilities to an organisation's business resilience and security. Due diligence should be carried out on critical suppliers and third parties to identify any risks associated with them or the services, products, or systems that they provide. The review will ascertain the level to which supplier risk is addressed within the organisation. Governance Whilst the CYSIAM Pathway framework is bespoke, it does cover the key aspects of several industry leading standards and regulations such as: ► NCSC Cyber Essentials & Cyber Essentials Plus ► ISO 27001 ► NIST Cyber Security Framework (CSF) ► GDPR ► PCI DSS (only used if relevant to business) Big 4 Consulting Firm “CYSIAM's key strengths would be industry experience and technical skills; across the board the CYSIAM team is really powerful in those areas.” Latest insights CYSIAM named CrowdStrike's Rising Star Partner of the Year 2025 Read More CYSIAM Partner with CrowdStrike to Protect UK Defence Supply Chain Read More CYSIAM achieves CREST SOC Accreditation Read More Supporting Organisations in Times of Crisis: CYSIAM awarded NCSC Cyber Incident Response Level 2 Read More Securing the UK Defence Supply Chain: The Impact of Emerging Standards & Certification.

Due diligence should be carried out on critical suppliers and third parties to identify any risks associated with them or the services, products, or systems that they provide. The review will ascertain the level to which supplier risk is addressed within the organisation. Governance Our framework is divided into the following seven areas, and whilst budgets or time may constrain the depth to which we examine an organisation, we never compromise on the breadth of our review. Governance Policy, process & procedure Technology Data handling Culture & education Physical environment Supply chain Governance Cyber-risk should be treated like any other business risk and should have board level ownership. This review will evaluate the approach to cyber-risk, how it defines roles and responsibilities, and if critical business dependencies have been identified along with the threats posed to them. Policy, process & procedure Appropriate documentation and working practices provide the necessary underlying foundation on which the correct business decisions can be made, whilst demonstrating compliance to relevant legislation and standards. Our review will evaluate existing policies and identify gaps in documentation and working practices that can be addressed to reduce cyber-risk. Technology Technology should comply with, and support, the security policies of an organisation. ICT teams (internal or outsourced) are usually focused on maintaining availability of the technology's functionality, and this can lead to mismanagement of technical security controls. We assess the 'real-life' approach against policies to identify any gaps (vulnerabilities). To this end, we can conduct vulnerability scans of the organisation's external and internal network and devices as part of a policy compliance assessment. Data handling Understanding the data that is processed is crucial not only for establishing and implementing the correct security controls, but also for legal compliance (GDPR). This review will confirm whether an organisation has identified the data it processes, transmits, and stores, and whether it has the necessary security in place to protect it. Culture & education People can be a critical weakness in cyber security but also a key aspect of defence. Understanding levels of awareness within an organisation and its workforce helps to identify areas of strengths and weakness and where to focus programmes of improvement. Culture plays an important role in the security of an organisation and our assessment will evaluate if cyber security awareness and understanding is embedded at all levels. Physical environment We look here at how physical access to an organisations ICT infrastructure is controlled, from server rooms to network access points to individual devices.

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy CYSIAM Partner with CrowdStrike to Protect UK Defence Supply Chain PRESS RELEASE: London, UK – 28 February 2025 – CYSIAM , a leading provider of cyber security and resilience services, today announced a partnership with CrowdStrike to strengthen cyber resilience across the UK Defence sector supply chain. Through this partnership, CYSIAM will equip defence organisations with advanced protection powered by the CrowdStrike Falcon® cybersecurity platform , safeguarding critical national infrastructure and enhancing the nation’s defence capabilities. The UK Defence sector supply chain faces increasingly sophisticated cyber threats, posing risks to the operational integrity and development of national defence systems. This partnership combines CYSIAM’s UK-based, 24/7 expertise in incident response and managed security services, with CrowdStrike’s industry-leading threat intelligence, AI-powered Endpoint Security and Falcon® Next-Gen SIEM . Together, they deliver proactive, real-time defence capabilities to combat advanced cyber threats. The UK Ministry of Defence is increasing the focus on cyber resilience through updated guidance and compliance standards for its supply chain. This has recently been emphasised to Defence Sector CEOs and Business Leaders by a letter from the Second Permanent Secretary, DG Chief Information Officer, and DG Commercial stating the importance of implementing the new Cyber Security Standard for Suppliers ( DEF STAN 05-138 Issue 4 Cyber Security for Defence Suppliers ). CrowdStrike’s industry-leading technology complements CYSIAM’s innovative approach to securing complex supply chains. The partnership provides a comprehensive service that enables organisations within the defence ecosystem to identify vulnerabilities, respond swiftly to incidents and fortify their operations against future attacks. David Allan, CEO of CYSIAM , commented: “The UK Defence sector supply chain is the backbone of our national security, and it is imperative that it remains resilient in the face of escalating cyber threats. By partnering with CrowdStrike, we are ensuring our clients benefit from best-in-class technology and services to protect their assets and operations, while demonstrating compliance with risk-based procurement standards. This partnership reflects our shared commitment to strengthening the UK’s cyber defences at every level.” Ben Emslie, Vice President Sales, Northern Europe, CrowdStrike , added: “CYSIAM’s deep understanding of the UK Defence sector and supply chain dynamics aligns perfectly with CrowdStrike’s mission to stop breaches. Together, we’re delivering a security-first approach that empowers defence organisations to anticipate, detect, and respond to adversaries with AI in an increasingly complex threat landscape.” The partnership will focus on delivering bespoke cyber security solutions that align with the Ministry of Defence’s requirements and regulations, supporting compliance and operational excellence. It will also support ongoing efforts to enhance the resilience of the UK’s critical defence supply chain against current and emerging threats.

For some organisations, accessing quality incident response services has been a minefield – who can you trust to get you back up and running at an incredibly stressful time? For several years now, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has operated a scheme that would only assure companies providing incident response services to nationally significant organisations. To deal with the ever-changing landscape of cyber security across the UK, the NCSC has expanded that assurance programme and has introduced a Cyber Incident Response (Level 2) to increase awareness and availability of high-quality incident response providers. Today, we’re proud to announce that CYSIAM is among the first few companies in the UK to be awarded the new NCSC Cyber Incident Response Level 2. This achievement is testament to our unparalleled credibility in incident response and most importantly, provides a broad range of organisations with the assurance that we are a high-quality provider of incident response services. Don’t leave incident response services to chance – get in touch today to find out how we can help prevent a cyber-attack and, should the worse happen, work alongside you to get you back up and running.

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Securing the UK Defence Supply Chain: The Impact of Emerging Standards & Certification For many years, the UK Defence sector has increasingly been targeted by sophisticated and hostile cyber threat actors due to its strategic importance, sensitive data, and complex supply chain. This risk to our National Security is now being further compounded by geo-political factors such as the war in Ukraine, conflict in Gaza, global economic instability, and unpredictable US foreign policy. As we seek to reduce UK and European dependency on US military and economic influence, there are those who will look to hamper and disrupt our progress. The Cyber Security sector here in the UK has long been lobbying for more comprehensive and mandatory regulatory controls, not only for organisations and their supply chains delivering critical goods and services, but also for the managed IT and security service providers that claim to protect them. Not for the first time in our country’s history, it feels like the UK Defence sector is now at the tip of the spear in terms of making this required change happen. To address persistent vulnerabilities in supplier assurance and cyber risk management, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) has released Def Stan 05-138 Issue 4 , supported by the newly introduced Defence Cyber Certification (DCC) . For those organisations working in adjacent CNI sectors across Europe, this is in addition to the NIS2 Directive being implemented across the EU, and the Cyber Security & Resilience Bill currently moving through approvals here in the UK. Together, these initiatives mark a transformative shift in how cyber resilience is built across the Defence supply chain, offering a structured, risk-based, and independently verifiable approach that strengthens national security while easing compliance ambiguity for suppliers. The UK Defence sector is a high-value target for adversaries seeking strategic gain or disruption, and the vast supply chain is especially vulnerable, often seen as the path of least resistance due to: Inconsistent security maturity among suppliers; Trusted relationships that can be exploited; Direct or indirect access to classified or sensitive data. Managing cyber risk in the Defence supply chain has historically faced several obstacles such as: Ambiguity in standards: Previous iterations of Def Stan 05-138, particularly Issue 3, lacked clarity and consistency; Cumbersome supplier assurance processes: Often duplicated across contracts and difficult to navigate; Lack of certification: No standardised external mechanism to validate supplier cyber posture, leading to inconsistent interpretation and implementation. Improvements in DEF STAN 05-138 Issue 4 of Def Stan 05-138 introduces a significantly improved framework for managing cyber security in the supply chain. Risk-based Cyber Risk Profiles (CRPs): A new model defines four levels of cyber assurance based on the sensitivity of data and system criticality: L0 – Basic L1 – Foundational L2 – Advanced L3 – Expert Whole-organisation security scope: Security obligations extend beyond project-specific systems to the entire organisation, recognising that threats can emerge from any part of a supplier’s operations. CAF alignment and integration with Cyber Essentials: The new standard aligns with the National Cyber Security Centre’s Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF), adopting its four core objectives (A-D). CRP levels dictate whether Cyber Essentials or Cyber Essentials Plus is required. Framework mapping: Def Stan 05-138 Issue 4 maps to common industry frameworks to reduce duplication and support suppliers in leveraging existing certifications and controls. Introduction of the Defence Cyber Certification (DCC) A transformative feature of the new approach is the introduction of the UK Defence Cyber Certification (DCC) , a long-needed mechanism to validate supplier cyber security maturity across contracts. The DCC directly addresses prior gaps in the assurance model, creating a foundation for consistent and scalable risk management across the Defence ecosystem. With supply chains as extensive as BAE Systems for example, which works with over 20,000 suppliers, prioritisation is essential. Defence organisations must focus their assurance efforts on suppliers who: Have access to sensitive data, technology, or personnel Operate under deeply trusted commercial relationships Are critical to the delivery of Defence missions The introduction of Def Stan 05-138 Issue 4 and the UK Defence Cyber Certification marks a significant evolution in how the UK MOD manages cyber security risk in its supply chain. This new, risk-based, and certifiable framework offers clarity, scalability, and consistency, helping protect national security interests while reducing compliance burdens for suppliers. As cyber threats continue to evolve, these changes ensure that the Defence sector can rely on a secure, resilient, and trusted supply chain. Why is the UK Cyber Security and Resilience Bill important? Finally, the forthcoming Cyber Security and Resilience Bill will place much more stringent requirements on cyber security service providers to sectors associated with critical public services. It is important now to prepare by checking the accreditations, credibility, and capability of the providers you appoint in preparation for a more regulated operating environment. As organisations in the Defence sector seek to meet the new required level of security and resilience controls contained within the Def Stan and strive for the appropriate level of certification, they will seek external advice, consultancy, and services from the IT and Cyber Security sector. The new Cyber Security and Resilience Bill brings outsourced managed service providers into scope as they hold digitally trusted and privileged access to clients’ infrastructure and data. As we have seen with high profile breaches over the last few years, the initial attack vector can come from the very companies claiming to be the protectors. These companies (including CYSIAM) must be regulated, accountable, and acutely aware of the risk that they themselves pose to their clients’ resilience. How can CYSIAM Help? CYSIAM provides practical support to suppliers seeking to align with Def Stan 05-138 and DCC requirements by providing: 24x7/365 UK-based Managed Security Services that meet CAF Objectives C and D for CRP Levels 2 and 3; Fully security-vetted consultancy and implementation assistance for CAF Objectives A and B, plus Cyber Essentials and Cyber essentials Plus. By partnering with CYSIAM, UK Defence suppliers can ensure timely, efficient, and fully compliant adoption of the new UK Defence cyber security standards. CYSIAM is a NCSC and CREST accredited service provider, ISO27001 and IASME certified for information security, and a Full Member of the globally recognised Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST).

Introduction of the Defence Cyber Certification (DCC) A transformative feature of the new approach is the introduction of the UK Defence Cyber Certification (DCC) , a long-needed mechanism to validate supplier cyber security maturity across contracts. The DCC directly addresses prior gaps in the assurance model, creating a foundation for consistent and scalable risk management across the Defence ecosystem. With supply chains as extensive as BAE Systems for example, which works with over 20,000 suppliers, prioritisation is essential. Defence organisations must focus their assurance efforts on suppliers who: Have access to sensitive data, technology, or personnel Operate under deeply trusted commercial relationships Are critical to the delivery of Defence missions The introduction of Def Stan 05-138 Issue 4 and the UK Defence Cyber Certification marks a significant evolution in how the UK MOD manages cyber security risk in its supply chain. This new, risk-based, and certifiable framework offers clarity, scalability, and consistency, helping protect national security interests while reducing compliance burdens for suppliers. As cyber threats continue to evolve, these changes ensure that the Defence sector can rely on a secure, resilient, and trusted supply chain. Why is the UK Cyber Security and Resilience Bill important? Finally, the forthcoming Cyber Security and Resilience Bill will place much more stringent requirements on cyber security service providers to sectors associated with critical public services. It is important now to prepare by checking the accreditations, credibility, and capability of the providers you appoint in preparation for a more regulated operating environment. As organisations in the Defence sector seek to meet the new required level of security and resilience controls contained within the Def Stan and strive for the appropriate level of certification, they will seek external advice, consultancy, and services from the IT and Cyber Security sector. The new Cyber Security and Resilience Bill brings outsourced managed service providers into scope as they hold digitally trusted and privileged access to clients’ infrastructure and data. As we have seen with high profile breaches over the last few years, the initial attack vector can come from the very companies claiming to be the protectors. These companies (including CYSIAM) must be regulated, accountable, and acutely aware of the risk that they themselves pose to their clients’ resilience. How can CYSIAM Help? CYSIAM provides practical support to suppliers seeking to align with Def Stan 05-138 and DCC requirements by providing: 24x7/365 UK-based Managed Security Services that meet CAF Objectives C and D for CRP Levels 2 and 3; Fully security-vetted consultancy and implementation assistance for CAF Objectives A and B, plus Cyber Essentials and Cyber essentials Plus. By partnering with CYSIAM, UK Defence suppliers can ensure timely, efficient, and fully compliant adoption of the new UK Defence cyber security standards. CYSIAM is a NCSC and CREST accredited service provider, ISO27001 and IASME certified for information security, and a Full Member of the globally recognised Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST). The company is also JOSCAR-certified and in 2022 was awarded the Gold Award by the UK MOD Employer Recognition Scheme (ERS). For many years, the UK Defence sector has increasingly been targeted by sophisticated and hostile cyber threat actors due to its strategic importance, sensitive data, and complex supply chain. This risk to our National Security is now being further compounded by geo-political factors such as the war in Ukraine, conflict in Gaza, global economic instability, and unpredictable US foreign policy. As we seek to reduce UK and European dependency on US military and economic influence, there are those who will look to hamper and disrupt our progress. The Cyber Security sector here in the UK has long been lobbying for more comprehensive and mandatory regulatory controls, not only for organisations and their supply chains delivering critical goods and services, but also for the managed IT and security service providers that claim to protect them. Not for the first time in our country’s history, it feels like the UK Defence sector is now at the tip of the spear in terms of making this required change happen. To address persistent vulnerabilities in supplier assurance and cyber risk management, the Ministry of Defence (MOD) has released Def Stan 05-138 Issue 4 , supported by the newly introduced Defence Cyber Certification (DCC) . For those organisations working in adjacent CNI sectors across Europe, this is in addition to the NIS2 Directive being implemented across the EU, and the Cyber Security & Resilience Bill currently moving through approvals here in the UK. Together, these initiatives mark a transformative shift in how cyber resilience is built across the Defence supply chain, offering a structured, risk-based, and independently verifiable approach that strengthens national security while easing compliance ambiguity for suppliers. The UK Defence sector is a high-value target for adversaries seeking strategic gain or disruption, and the vast supply chain is especially vulnerable, often seen as the path of least resistance due to: Inconsistent security maturity among suppliers; Trusted relationships that can be exploited; Direct or indirect access to classified or sensitive data. Managing cyber risk in the Defence supply chain has historically faced several obstacles such as: Ambiguity in standards: Previous iterations of Def Stan 05-138, particularly Issue 3, lacked clarity and consistency; Cumbersome supplier assurance processes: Often duplicated across contracts and difficult to navigate; Lack of certification: No standardised external mechanism to validate supplier cyber posture, leading to inconsistent interpretation and implementation. Improvements in DEF STAN 05-138 Issue 4 of Def Stan 05-138 introduces a significantly improved framework for managing cyber security in the supply chain. Risk-based Cyber Risk Profiles (CRPs): A new model defines four levels of cyber assurance based on the sensitivity of data and system criticality: L0 – Basic L1 – Foundational L2 – Advanced L3 – Expert Whole-organisation security scope: Security obligations extend beyond project-specific systems to the entire organisation, recognising that threats can emerge from any part of a supplier’s operations. CAF alignment and integration with Cyber Essentials: The new standard aligns with the National Cyber Security Centre’s Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF), adopting its four core objectives (A-D). CRP levels dictate whether Cyber Essentials or Cyber Essentials Plus is required.

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy The Value of Protecting Your Data Privacy At CYSIAM we take data privacy very seriously and we’re dedicated to empowering individuals and encouraging businesses to value and protect their data privacy. OUR TOP 5 TIPS TO HELP YOU PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY: Be aware of who you provide your personal information to and how it’s collected. It is important to know who has access to your information as well as what they are going to do with it. Set the privacy and security settings on websites and apps to your comfort level for information sharing. Think before posting about yourself and others online. Consider what it reveals, who might see it and how it could be perceived now and in the future. It is advisable not keep data for longer than you need it. Delete unused apps from your phones and tablets, delete old emails and data you no longer require. Clear cookies from browsers regularly and consider using private browsing or a dedicated privacy browser. Don’t make online payments or access private accounts on a shared computer or using open public Wi-Fi as you cannot guarantee how secure the network or device is. Instead, use your own device on a secure network to stay safe. Protect your web browsing and online activities by using a Virtual Private Network (VPN). Protect your online accounts with strong passwords and, where possible, multi-factor authentication (MFA).

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy How To Combat An Incident Response Nightmare By Luke Price – Senior Technical Consultant Imagine the following scenario, you’re a business owner about to leave work and return home to enjoy some well-deserved down time. Your work phone rings, dread washes over you as you look at the caller ID; one of your IT staff is calling about to ruin your night. An employee’s machine has been encrypted with malware, restricting access after a successful phishing attempt. In addition to this, rampant pop-ups demanding an instant ransom payment is the cherry on top. Questions like ‘who caused this’, ‘is it localised’ and ‘do we have the finances to pay the ransom’ are bound to whip through your mind, potentially even ‘do we have an incident response plan?’ If the answers to the above questions are ‘no’ and you have neither an incident response (IR) plan or policies in place to deal with a nightmare like this, worry not, everyone starts somewhere. This blog won’t have all the answers, but it should help serve as a springboard to steer your business and you in the right direction. What is an Incident Response (IR) Plan? An IR plan is essentially a set of guidelines to help a business plan and facilitate effective incident response strategies. The plan could detail how an incident is handled, to the processes involved or escalation procedures. Why is it helpful? Random actions provide random results, especially in times of high stress and pressure. A well-defined IR plan will help co-ordinate people, processes and technology meaning you can act quickly to minimise the damage caused and prevent similar incidents in the future. Where do I start? CYSIAM recommends using the internationally recognised Incident Response Plan and handbook created by SANS [i] . Broken down into six steps, the following stages will provide a foundation for your team to be able to perform incident response, as well as creating a unique, tailored IR plan for your business. Preparation This phase, as its name implies, deals with preparing a team to be ready to handle an incident as a moment’s notice. Regardless of the cause, preparation is the most crucial phase as it will determine how well your team will be able to respond in a crisis. Firstly, a policy needs to be developed with a set of principles or rules to identify whether an incident has occurred. Next, a procedure/response plan is required alongside documentation which incident responders can record key information against, such as timestamp of incident, patient zero, affected hosts, person(s) that reported an incident, type of incident and incident severity. Having a communication plan is also necessary; the entire cyber security incident response team (CSIRT) should know whom to contact (especially your escalation contacts), when is it appropriate to contact them and why. Responses to incidents can be severely hampered due to organisations skipping over a communication plan. As a note, the points above are not exhaustive, but gives you’re an idea of the track to start on. Identification We need to understand the threat and the scope of the incident within this phase. Are we dealing with ransomware? If so, how widespread or localised is it? This step requires information to be gathered from various sources such as log files, error messages and other resources, such as intrusion detection systems and firewalls as to determine the incident. Helpful questions to ask the CSIRT could be; What malicious network connections are there? Any abnormal processes? What files were dropped because of the threat? Any affected users or compromised accounts? Which hosts were infected? This is also the phase where incident responders should be documenting everything they are doing; they should be gathering and documenting the who, what, where, why and how. The more you understand a threat, the easier it is to contain and eradicate. However, the amount of information you can garner about a threat will depend on your own security monitoring and analysis capabilities, this should be reviewed within the preparation phase. Containment The primary purpose of this phase is to limit the damage and prevent any further damage from happening. The scope and the threat pertaining to the incident has been identified, we can now isolate any affected systems from the network and reset any compromised accounts to minimise damage to the business, this is otherwise known as short-term containment. Next, system back-up is required before wiping and re-imaging any system to take a forensic image of the affected system(s) with tools such as EnCase or Forensic Tool Kit (FTK). Lastly, comes long-term containment where affected systems can be temporarily fixed in order to allow them to continue to be used. The effectiveness of the ‘containment’ phase will heavily depend on the layout and segmentation of your network as well as whether your IT staff fundamentally understand the network. Again, this revolves around your organisation’s current security capabilities and preparation; some businesses lack detailed network diagrams or an understanding of their network infrastructure therefore making the ‘containment’ phase more difficult. Eradication This phase deals with the actual removal and restoration of affected systems; it’s now time to clean up the evil whilst still isolated in the network. If your systems have been hit with ransomware, a key point to remember is that most anti-malware vendors have a lead time for submitting signatures to them. You can think of a signature as a typical footprint or pattern associated with a malicious attack. You’ll need to scan your systems for the malware signature and subsequently remove it. You may also install patches and disable unused services to harden the system against further attacks. Recovery It’s time to bring impacted systems back into the production environment carefully, as to ensure that it will not lead to another incident. It is essential to test, monitor and validate the systems that are being put back into production to verify they are not being re-infected by malware and risk another nightmare situation. In terms of monitoring, this stage will be constrained by the skills and tools available to your IT staff. Ideally you would monitor for malicious network connections or unusual processes from restored systems, or simply validate previously seen abnormalities are no longer present. There is a wealth of open-source tools available to IT teams to be able to facilitate a baseline monitoring capability, though this will require training and research by your IT team. Many commercial tools are also available, but care should be taken to understand why you may implement a certain tool and the role it will play within a business, context is everything. Lessons Learned Lessons learned is a stage to complete any documentation that was not done during the incident, as well as any additional documentation that may be beneficial in future incidents. This could include creating a playbook which details the technical steps the CSIRT should take in a future similar incident or highlight the areas of improvement required. The overall goal is to learn from the incident and improve the team’s performance. Ideally, a process to facilitate lessons learned would be drafted within the preparation phase to ensure it is carried out promptly after the incident; a good rule of thumb is two weeks post incident. Conclusion Although it was a quick whistle stop tour, this blog should have provided the foundation for IT professionals and managers to be able to create their own IR plan. As mentioned in the introduction, a well-defined IR plan will help co-ordinate people, processes and technology meaning you can act quickly to minimise the damage caused and prevent similar incidents in the future.

Regardless of the cause, preparation is the most crucial phase as it will determine how well your team will be able to respond in a crisis. Firstly, a policy needs to be developed with a set of principles or rules to identify whether an incident has occurred. Next, a procedure/response plan is required alongside documentation which incident responders can record key information against, such as timestamp of incident, patient zero, affected hosts, person(s) that reported an incident, type of incident and incident severity. Having a communication plan is also necessary; the entire cyber security incident response team (CSIRT) should know whom to contact (especially your escalation contacts), when is it appropriate to contact them and why. Responses to incidents can be severely hampered due to organisations skipping over a communication plan. As a note, the points above are not exhaustive, but gives you’re an idea of the track to start on. Identification We need to understand the threat and the scope of the incident within this phase. Are we dealing with ransomware? If so, how widespread or localised is it? This step requires information to be gathered from various sources such as log files, error messages and other resources, such as intrusion detection systems and firewalls as to determine the incident. Helpful questions to ask the CSIRT could be; What malicious network connections are there? Any abnormal processes? What files were dropped because of the threat? Any affected users or compromised accounts? Which hosts were infected? This is also the phase where incident responders should be documenting everything they are doing; they should be gathering and documenting the who, what, where, why and how. The more you understand a threat, the easier it is to contain and eradicate. However, the amount of information you can garner about a threat will depend on your own security monitoring and analysis capabilities, this should be reviewed within the preparation phase. Containment The primary purpose of this phase is to limit the damage and prevent any further damage from happening. The scope and the threat pertaining to the incident has been identified, we can now isolate any affected systems from the network and reset any compromised accounts to minimise damage to the business, this is otherwise known as short-term containment. Next, system back-up is required before wiping and re-imaging any system to take a forensic image of the affected system(s) with tools such as EnCase or Forensic Tool Kit (FTK). Lastly, comes long-term containment where affected systems can be temporarily fixed in order to allow them to continue to be used. The effectiveness of the ‘containment’ phase will heavily depend on the layout and segmentation of your network as well as whether your IT staff fundamentally understand the network. Again, this revolves around your organisation’s current security capabilities and preparation; some businesses lack detailed network diagrams or an understanding of their network infrastructure therefore making the ‘containment’ phase more difficult. Eradication This phase deals with the actual removal and restoration of affected systems; it’s now time to clean up the evil whilst still isolated in the network. If your systems have been hit with ransomware, a key point to remember is that most anti-malware vendors have a lead time for submitting signatures to them. You can think of a signature as a typical footprint or pattern associated with a malicious attack. You’ll need to scan your systems for the malware signature and subsequently remove it. You may also install patches and disable unused services to harden the system against further attacks. Recovery It’s time to bring impacted systems back into the production environment carefully, as to ensure that it will not lead to another incident. It is essential to test, monitor and validate the systems that are being put back into production to verify they are not being re-infected by malware and risk another nightmare situation. In terms of monitoring, this stage will be constrained by the skills and tools available to your IT staff. Ideally you would monitor for malicious network connections or unusual processes from restored systems, or simply validate previously seen abnormalities are no longer present. There is a wealth of open-source tools available to IT teams to be able to facilitate a baseline monitoring capability, though this will require training and research by your IT team. Many commercial tools are also available, but care should be taken to understand why you may implement a certain tool and the role it will play within a business, context is everything. Lessons Learned Lessons learned is a stage to complete any documentation that was not done during the incident, as well as any additional documentation that may be beneficial in future incidents. This could include creating a playbook which details the technical steps the CSIRT should take in a future similar incident or highlight the areas of improvement required. The overall goal is to learn from the incident and improve the team’s performance. Ideally, a process to facilitate lessons learned would be drafted within the preparation phase to ensure it is carried out promptly after the incident; a good rule of thumb is two weeks post incident. Conclusion Although it was a quick whistle stop tour, this blog should have provided the foundation for IT professionals and managers to be able to create their own IR plan. As mentioned in the introduction, a well-defined IR plan will help co-ordinate people, processes and technology meaning you can act quickly to minimise the damage caused and prevent similar incidents in the future. [i] https://sansorg.egnyte.com/dl/... Imagine the following scenario, you’re a business owner about to leave work and return home to enjoy some well-deserved down time. Your work phone rings, dread washes over you as you look at the caller ID; one of your IT staff is calling about to ruin your night. An employee’s machine has been encrypted with malware, restricting access after a successful phishing attempt. In addition to this, rampant pop-ups demanding an instant ransom payment is the cherry on top. Questions like ‘who caused this’, ‘is it localised’ and ‘do we have the finances to pay the ransom’ are bound to whip through your mind, potentially even ‘do we have an incident response plan?’ If the answers to the above questions are ‘no’ and you have neither an incident response (IR) plan or policies in place to deal with a nightmare like this, worry not, everyone starts somewhere. This blog won’t have all the answers, but it should help serve as a springboard to steer your business and you in the right direction. What is an Incident Response (IR) Plan? An IR plan is essentially a set of guidelines to help a business plan and facilitate effective incident response strategies. The plan could detail how an incident is handled, to the processes involved or escalation procedures. Random actions provide random results, especially in times of high stress and pressure. A well-defined IR plan will help co-ordinate people, processes and technology meaning you can act quickly to minimise the damage caused and prevent similar incidents in the future. CYSIAM recommends using the internationally recognised Incident Response Plan and handbook created by SANS [i] . Broken down into six steps, the following stages will provide a foundation for your team to be able to perform incident response, as well as creating a unique, tailored IR plan for your business.

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Cyber Security: Why Is It So Hard? By Rick Jack – Principal Consultant Despite the increased awareness and vast array of technology solutions promising protection, cyber security is still a challenge. Here is a quick look at some of the common difficulties that organisations and cyber security professionals may face, along with tips on how to deal with them. The Colour of Cyber What is cyber? Is it just IT? Is it computers, mobile phones, applications? Does it include information security, data protection, physical security, websites, emails, printed emails? If cyber cannot be clearly defined to your employees, then how can you expect them to secure it? Although the UK’s NCSC defines cyber security as “protecting the devices we all use (smartphones, laptops, tablets, and computers), and the services we access – both online and at work – from theft or damage” [i] , there is no agreed upon definition published by an international body. A cohesive approach to defining ‘cyber security’ is required to reduce confusion around its scope. Smoke and mirrors – Too much jargon The cyber community often don’t help themselves… shrouded in mystery, filled with jargon to confuse their audience in an act of self-preservation, in turn, stunting the spread of understanding. Lack of knowledge, or worse, lack of wanting to understand, means people are likely to avoid the subject full stop. Burying heads in the sand only results in further negative effects when referring to cyber security. For example, not addressing vulnerabilities due to lack of knowledge about the problem, or the solution, will not make them go away, the vulnerabilities will just become bigger and more difficult to ignore. The industry needs to settle on recognized terminology and cut jargon to a minimum if it’s to encourage others to take an active approach towards securing their cyber security space. The Gamble – Risk v Reward One of the hardest challenges that cyber security professionals must overcome is that the main purpose of most businesses is to make a profit. It can be very difficult to equate investment in cyber security with tangible returns. Hypothetical threats about the impact of breaches leading to fines, damaged reputation, and lost revenue, only go so far when trying to convince a Board to part with their money. This is particularly evident in the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector where budgets tend to be tighter and the investment with the least immediate return, typically cyber security, may fall down the list of priorities. How to ‘sell’ cyber security investment is one of the biggest hurdles for cyber security professionals. Achilles and the tortoise – Where does it end? The Achilles paradox states that a faster runner – Achilles – can never catch a slower tortoise in a race where the tortoise had a head start. The reason being that every time Achilles reaches the location the tortoise was at, the tortoise has moved on, continuing infinitely. The IT Security Manager who is starting from a position with multiple vulnerabilities or security gaps, may feel like Achilles and that they can never catch the attackers who had a head start. As soon as they think they are catching up and fix one hole, another is found, leading to a feeling that it is never-ending. Not my problem! Typically, for someone to care about a topic, they need to feel involved and potentially directly affected. Telling fellow colleagues that cyber security is “everyone’s responsibility” without helping them to understand the reasoning behind this statement can lead to an attitude of “not my problem, that’s what the IT and Security teams are for”. This is well known to not be the case and a strong security posture requires everyone to play a part and understand their role. What can we do? It’s not all negative, there are some simple, low-cost mitigations that can be implemented to help address the challenges above: Communication is key! When talking about cyber security within your organization, agree on the definition and scope and make sure this is communicated to all employees. When making cyber security changes, explain the reasons behind decisions and the associated impact (both good and bad) on employees personally and the business – all without jargon! More carrot, less stick! Focus on the benefits of cyber security as opposed to the potential penalties for not implementing it. Threats only go so far. Make training and awareness relatable to users’ everyday lives to build a security-focussed mindset, even in their personal lives. Guidance that users can implement at home is often also applicable to the business. Set overall objectives or goals, then break them down into small achievable tasks, each one with a demonstrable step change or tangible achievement. Accept that you cannot fix everything overnight, but plan to address the biggest gaps or highest risks first. Start with the ‘quick wins’, those actions that are cost-free or cheap and easy to achieve. For example, building an inventory of what you’re trying to protect, creating a security policy, or implementing multi-factor authentication. Security doesn’t have to be a shiny, expensive, new box; it can be as simple as reviewing current users on the network or adding a confirmation step prior to accepting bank account changes.

Is it computers, mobile phones, applications? Does it include information security, data protection, physical security, websites, emails, printed emails? If cyber cannot be clearly defined to your employees, then how can you expect them to secure it? Although the UK’s NCSC defines cyber security as “protecting the devices we all use (smartphones, laptops, tablets, and computers), and the services we access – both online and at work – from theft or damage” [i] , there is no agreed upon definition published by an international body. A cohesive approach to defining ‘cyber security’ is required to reduce confusion around its scope. Smoke and mirrors – Too much jargon The cyber community often don’t help themselves… shrouded in mystery, filled with jargon to confuse their audience in an act of self-preservation, in turn, stunting the spread of understanding. Lack of knowledge, or worse, lack of wanting to understand, means people are likely to avoid the subject full stop. Burying heads in the sand only results in further negative effects when referring to cyber security. For example, not addressing vulnerabilities due to lack of knowledge about the problem, or the solution, will not make them go away, the vulnerabilities will just become bigger and more difficult to ignore. The industry needs to settle on recognized terminology and cut jargon to a minimum if it’s to encourage others to take an active approach towards securing their cyber security space. The Gamble – Risk v Reward One of the hardest challenges that cyber security professionals must overcome is that the main purpose of most businesses is to make a profit. It can be very difficult to equate investment in cyber security with tangible returns. Hypothetical threats about the impact of breaches leading to fines, damaged reputation, and lost revenue, only go so far when trying to convince a Board to part with their money. This is particularly evident in the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector where budgets tend to be tighter and the investment with the least immediate return, typically cyber security, may fall down the list of priorities. How to ‘sell’ cyber security investment is one of the biggest hurdles for cyber security professionals. Achilles and the tortoise – Where does it end? The Achilles paradox states that a faster runner – Achilles – can never catch a slower tortoise in a race where the tortoise had a head start. The reason being that every time Achilles reaches the location the tortoise was at, the tortoise has moved on, continuing infinitely. The IT Security Manager who is starting from a position with multiple vulnerabilities or security gaps, may feel like Achilles and that they can never catch the attackers who had a head start. As soon as they think they are catching up and fix one hole, another is found, leading to a feeling that it is never-ending. Typically, for someone to care about a topic, they need to feel involved and potentially directly affected. Telling fellow colleagues that cyber security is “everyone’s responsibility” without helping them to understand the reasoning behind this statement can lead to an attitude of “not my problem, that’s what the IT and Security teams are for”. This is well known to not be the case and a strong security posture requires everyone to play a part and understand their role. It’s not all negative, there are some simple, low-cost mitigations that can be implemented to help address the challenges above: Communication is key! When talking about cyber security within your organization, agree on the definition and scope and make sure this is communicated to all employees. When making cyber security changes, explain the reasons behind decisions and the associated impact (both good and bad) on employees personally and the business – all without jargon! More carrot, less stick! Focus on the benefits of cyber security as opposed to the potential penalties for not implementing it. Threats only go so far. Make training and awareness relatable to users’ everyday lives to build a security-focussed mindset, even in their personal lives. Guidance that users can implement at home is often also applicable to the business. Set overall objectives or goals, then break them down into small achievable tasks, each one with a demonstrable step change or tangible achievement. Accept that you cannot fix everything overnight, but plan to address the biggest gaps or highest risks first. Start with the ‘quick wins’, those actions that are cost-free or cheap and easy to achieve. For example, building an inventory of what you’re trying to protect, creating a security policy, or implementing multi-factor authentication. Security doesn’t have to be a shiny, expensive, new box; it can be as simple as reviewing current users on the network or adding a confirmation step prior to accepting bank account changes.

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Do You Need A Penetration Test? By Matthew Brooker – Senior Technical Consultant Before answering the question above, it’s probably best to clarify the definition of a penetration test, or pen test, as its more commonly known. Although it’s a term used frequently in both the cyber security and IT sector, it can also be bounded around without many knowing the true purpose, context or aim, resulting in some confusion and questions such as “do I need a pen test?” arising. In terms of a definition, the NCSC defines a penetration test as “a method for gaining assurance in the security of an IT system, by attempting to breach some or all of that system’s security, using the same tools and techniques as an adversary might”[i]. Typically, a pen test is used to identify the level of technical risk posed from software and hardware vulnerabilities. Being able to identify these vulnerabilities before a threat actor takes advantage, plus being issued with a report detailing the remediation recommendations means your organization can stay one step ahead of cyber criminals. With the above in mind, you may be thinking a pen test is the best bet at keeping your organisation safe, but its usefulness can depend on your business requirements. CYSIAM have occasionally come across organisations who declare with certainty that they “must get a pen test asap” but this opinion has been formed based on bad advice or misunderstanding of a pen test’s purpose. With the aim of helping determine whether there is a business need for a pen test, you’ll first need to ask yourself a few questions; 1.Do you understand your attack surface? Without knowing the organisations attack surface (whether this be internal or external), it is impossible to know what controls you have in place to protect it. Analysing your attack surface will enable you to; identify what functions and what parts of the system you need to review/test for security vulnerabilities. identify high risk assets and information. identify where the systems are located, who controls them, who has access to them and why. 2. Have there been any major changes that might affect security? If any major changes have been implemented recently, it is good practice to conduct some sort of assurance activity to ensure the desired change is working as expected, but also to confirm that the change hasn’t created any new risk to the organisation. 3. Is it required as part of recovery from a security incident? Post incident, it is wise to conduct an assessment once all remediation efforts have been completed. This will enable the organisation to confirm the remediation steps have worked as planned, moreover, understand if there are any other immediate threats to their landscape. 4. Is there a specific reason for wanting a penetration test? It may be required as part of a contractual agreement, or to show compliance with an industry standard (PCI DSS, CBEST etc). If your answers to questions 1 through to 4 are ‘no’, then it’s likely that you do not need a pen test – at least not right now. It’s much more likely that you need to conduct a baseline assessment of your people, processes, and technology first[ii]. A pen test conducted without good understanding of your networks could result in it being ineffective and therefore a report that has an adverse instead of positive effect on the organisation. That doesn’t mean that you should rule out testing altogether. You could consider a network vulnerability scan, vulnerability assessment or a phishing assessment which are essential tools in understanding which systems need patching, updating, or reconfiguring to make them more secure. In summary, the throw-away comment from a organisation of “oh, I need a pen test” may occasionally be spot on, but there are questions that need to be answered before reaching this decision. An organisation can save time and money by waiting for the right time to conduct a pen test and instead invest resources into smaller steps.

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Managing Supply Chain Cyber Risks By James Kench – CYSIAM Chief Operating Officer Employing good cyber practice, such as not using the same passwords on different applications and using multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible is not just about protecting ourselves. In the same way as practicing good personal hygiene, such as washing hands helps others by reducing transmission of infectious diseases, good cyber practice helps reduce the risk that you will be used as a vector by a nefarious cyber actor (criminal, hacktivist etc) to obtain access into other peoples or companies’ networks. Most reasonably sized organisations have recognised that they have quite a lot to lose if their data systems were exploited in some way. This could be a hospital with ICU machines connected to their network, a law firm with confidential customer data stored on servers, or an airline with an online booking system. Once this recognition has been established and the risk raised to a sufficient level, the organisation is likely to have put in place robust cyber defences such as firewalls, passwords, and MFA to protect its core functions. Attackers know this and rather waste time on a difficult target, they are increasingly focusing on supply chains as an easier alternative, a “soft underbelly” if you will. Suppliers, such as outsourced software providers, website builders and IT managed service providers often have access to their customer’s critical data and systems making them a target. Cyber-attacks on these kinds of organisations are certainly on the rise. An August 2021 article in “Supply Management”, the magazine of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, ran with the headline “Supply Chain Cyber Attacks to Quadruple” [i] . This is not a problem that is going to go away, and all organisations should recognise and manage this risk. So, what should you do about supply chain vulnerabilities? Well, the first step is to recognise the risk and ensure that accountability for the risk is held at the highest level in the organisation possible, preferably the board. Don’t assume that this is simply an IT risk, it is a business risk and therefore requires a business solution. Next, you should identify which of your suppliers are critical. You may not have the time, funds, or energy to treat your whole supply chain in the same way, furthermore, your actions need to be proportionate to the potential impact. Your critical suppliers will be unique to your organisation, but you could start by asking questions such as “do they hold or handle any critical data or other assets?”, “do they have priority to our internal systems?” and “if they failed could we still operate?”. In parallel to identifying your critical suppliers you should be establishing a target cyber maturity position for these suppliers. We would use the CYSIAM 7 factor assessment to assist with this activity (Figure 1) but there are various models available. The ideal target cyber maturity position will be unique to the nature of your business and your appetitive for risk. For example, it may be that you care less about assessing your supplier’s physical environment because their remote working policy means a low level of maturity in this area is sufficient, or that because they only have 3 employees you care less about assessing their culture and education because it presents less of a risk to you. Once you have established (a) your critical suppliers and (b) their target cyber maturity positions, these suppliers should be assessed to establish their current level of cyber defence capability. Then a joint action plan should be drawn up to deliver the necessary change between current and target maturity levels. Delivering this change becomes your cyber maturity improvement programme. Again, we would use the CYSIAM 7 factor assessment at this stage as a measure of cyber defence maturity. The gap between current (dark green) and target maturity levels (light green) can be illustrated well using a radar or “spider web” diagram as shown below: Figur e 1 – CYSIAM 7 Factor Maturity Assessment for Suppliers The important point is that this assessment should be used to agree joint actions and objectives with your critical suppliers, aimed at bringing the cyber defence capability up to the necessary level of maturity. The joint actions and objectives should then be systematically implemented and periodically reviewed by both parties to ensure continued and sustained change. Non-critical suppliers should still be included in any cyber maturity improvement programme just in slightly less depth. Engagement with this category of supplier should be developed over time as part of a planned Supplier Relationship Management initiative. Initial steps could be to include mandatory compliance to recognised cyber standard(s) such as Cyber Essentials, as a contractual requirement, request evidence of regular internal audits on cyber procedures and practices and requiring the holding of appropriate cyber insurances. In addition to the above, the NCSC’s 12 principles are a great guide and can be found here: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/supply-chain-security .

In the same way as practicing good personal hygiene, such as washing hands helps others by reducing transmission of infectious diseases, good cyber practice helps reduce the risk that you will be used as a vector by a nefarious cyber actor (criminal, hacktivist etc) to obtain access into other peoples or companies’ networks. Most reasonably sized organisations have recognised that they have quite a lot to lose if their data systems were exploited in some way. This could be a hospital with ICU machines connected to their network, a law firm with confidential customer data stored on servers, or an airline with an online booking system. Once this recognition has been established and the risk raised to a sufficient level, the organisation is likely to have put in place robust cyber defences such as firewalls, passwords, and MFA to protect its core functions. Attackers know this and rather waste time on a difficult target, they are increasingly focusing on supply chains as an easier alternative, a “soft underbelly” if you will. Suppliers, such as outsourced software providers, website builders and IT managed service providers often have access to their customer’s critical data and systems making them a target. Cyber-attacks on these kinds of organisations are certainly on the rise. An August 2021 article in “Supply Management”, the magazine of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply, ran with the headline “Supply Chain Cyber Attacks to Quadruple” [i] . This is not a problem that is going to go away, and all organisations should recognise and manage this risk. So, what should you do about supply chain vulnerabilities? Well, the first step is to recognise the risk and ensure that accountability for the risk is held at the highest level in the organisation possible, preferably the board. Don’t assume that this is simply an IT risk, it is a business risk and therefore requires a business solution. Next, you should identify which of your suppliers are critical. You may not have the time, funds, or energy to treat your whole supply chain in the same way, furthermore, your actions need to be proportionate to the potential impact. Your critical suppliers will be unique to your organisation, but you could start by asking questions such as “do they hold or handle any critical data or other assets?”, “do they have priority to our internal systems?” and “if they failed could we still operate?”. In parallel to identifying your critical suppliers you should be establishing a target cyber maturity position for these suppliers. We would use the CYSIAM 7 factor assessment to assist with this activity (Figure 1) but there are various models available. The ideal target cyber maturity position will be unique to the nature of your business and your appetitive for risk. For example, it may be that you care less about assessing your supplier’s physical environment because their remote working policy means a low level of maturity in this area is sufficient, or that because they only have 3 employees you care less about assessing their culture and education because it presents less of a risk to you. Once you have established (a) your critical suppliers and (b) their target cyber maturity positions, these suppliers should be assessed to establish their current level of cyber defence capability. Then a joint action plan should be drawn up to deliver the necessary change between current and target maturity levels. Delivering this change becomes your cyber maturity improvement programme. Again, we would use the CYSIAM 7 factor assessment at this stage as a measure of cyber defence maturity. The gap between current (dark green) and target maturity levels (light green) can be illustrated well using a radar or “spider web” diagram as shown below: Figur e 1 – CYSIAM 7 Factor Maturity Assessment for Suppliers The important point is that this assessment should be used to agree joint actions and objectives with your critical suppliers, aimed at bringing the cyber defence capability up to the necessary level of maturity. The joint actions and objectives should then be systematically implemented and periodically reviewed by both parties to ensure continued and sustained change. Non-critical suppliers should still be included in any cyber maturity improvement programme just in slightly less depth. Engagement with this category of supplier should be developed over time as part of a planned Supplier Relationship Management initiative. Initial steps could be to include mandatory compliance to recognised cyber standard(s) such as Cyber Essentials, as a contractual requirement, request evidence of regular internal audits on cyber procedures and practices and requiring the holding of appropriate cyber insurances. In addition to the above, the NCSC’s 12 principles are a great guide and can be found here: https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/supply-chain-security .

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Information Classification: Build The Basics To Get The Benefits By Paul W – Senior Technical Consultant Having spent many years in the military, I was very familiar with the concept of protecting information. Information classification was predominately used to deny the enemy our secrets so we could maintain an advantage, but since moving into the private sector, my understanding of information and its value to an organisation has developed. Security is not just about protecting secrets. It’s also about respecting personal information, complying with regulations and more importantly, appreciating how information drives an organisation. What is information classification? Information Classification is when an organisation provides its information assets with an appropriate level of protection based on its perceived value. There are many different factors that can help to determine value, which might include: Legislation and regulations such as the Data Protection Act 2018. Information assets that have been deemed critical to organisational operations, e.g. financial information, computer code or customer databases. Contractual agreements such as Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs). How is information classified? There are many approaches to classifying information, such as the UK Government Classification System , but typically the most common information classification labels are public, confidential, commercial, sensitive and personal. Methods to protect valuable information will normally include a combination of technology, people, and process controls. So, what are we trying to protect? There are three aspects to information and its security that must be considered: confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA), often called the “CIA Triad”. The objective of Information Classification and Information Protection, more generally, is to preserve the CIA triad of organisations’ most critical information assets. Doing this well will reduce the likelihood of a data breach. The CIA test is – “What would be the consequences to the organisation if”: C – unauthorised people could see/access the information? I – the information was maliciously or accidentally modified? A – the information could not be accessed by the right people at the right time? If the answer to any of these questions is “the consequences would be damaging or even catastrophic to the organisation” , then you will need to apply protective controls, like information classification, around that information asset. What do organisations need to do? Clearly, we want to protect information, but there is normally so much of it that you cannot see the wood from the trees. Organisations need to prioritise which information assets are the most valuable and/or present the most risk to them. The most restrictive controls should be applied to the information that is deemed highest value or most at risk. This will vary depending on each organisation, but will involve understanding: What information the organisation holds Where the information is stored Value of the information How the information is used What risks are associated with the information What resources are available to protect the information The Benefits of Information Classification There are many benefits of introducing an Information Classification system, and associated controls, into your organisation including: Reduced risk of data breaches – The fallout of breaches today can include financial penalties and reputational damage, both of which can be catastrophic for organisations to recover from. Increased compliance – Adhering to information security standards and frameworks such as ISO 27001, IASME, PCI-DSS, NIS CAF, NIST and GDPR can provide the organisation reduced insurance premiums and competitive advantage through access to opportunities that require defined information security standards. Increased efficiency – Classified data can be easily found; changes are tracked and traced meaning employees are able to execute daily operations more efficiently. Increased culture of security awareness – Asking employees to take responsibility for protecting information by ensuring they understand the value of information they work with can build a culture of security awareness. Increased organisational understanding – Information classification provides the organisation with a better understanding of information security risks to enable mitigations to be applied. Implementing any new system or change can be a challenge, especially when it involves technical and non-technical elements, but making the move to an information classification system can deliver tangible advantages for any organisation.

Doing this well will reduce the likelihood of a data breach. The CIA test is – “What would be the consequences to the organisation if”: C – unauthorised people could see/access the information? I – the information was maliciously or accidentally modified? A – the information could not be accessed by the right people at the right time? If the answer to any of these questions is “the consequences would be damaging or even catastrophic to the organisation” , then you will need to apply protective controls, like information classification, around that information asset. What do organisations need to do? Clearly, we want to protect information, but there is normally so much of it that you cannot see the wood from the trees. Organisations need to prioritise which information assets are the most valuable and/or present the most risk to them. The most restrictive controls should be applied to the information that is deemed highest value or most at risk. This will vary depending on each organisation, but will involve understanding: What information the organisation holds Where the information is stored Value of the information How the information is used What risks are associated with the information What resources are available to protect the information The Benefits of Information Classification There are many benefits of introducing an Information Classification system, and associated controls, into your organisation including: Reduced risk of data breaches – The fallout of breaches today can include financial penalties and reputational damage, both of which can be catastrophic for organisations to recover from. Increased compliance – Adhering to information security standards and frameworks such as ISO 27001, IASME, PCI-DSS, NIS CAF, NIST and GDPR can provide the organisation reduced insurance premiums and competitive advantage through access to opportunities that require defined information security standards. Increased efficiency – Classified data can be easily found; changes are tracked and traced meaning employees are able to execute daily operations more efficiently. Increased culture of security awareness – Asking employees to take responsibility for protecting information by ensuring they understand the value of information they work with can build a culture of security awareness. Increased organisational understanding – Information classification provides the organisation with a better understanding of information security risks to enable mitigations to be applied. Implementing any new system or change can be a challenge, especially when it involves technical and non-technical elements, but making the move to an information classification system can deliver tangible advantages for any organisation. If you’d like to find out more about how we can help your organisation start or develop your information security journey, feel free to get in touch. Having spent many years in the military, I was very familiar with the concept of protecting information. Information classification was predominately used to deny the enemy our secrets so we could maintain an advantage, but since moving into the private sector, my understanding of information and its value to an organisation has developed. Security is not just about protecting secrets. It’s also about respecting personal information, complying with regulations and more importantly, appreciating how information drives an organisation. What is information classification? Information Classification is when an organisation provides its information assets with an appropriate level of protection based on its perceived value. There are many different factors that can help to determine value, which might include: Legislation and regulations such as the Data Protection Act 2018. Information assets that have been deemed critical to organisational operations, e.g. financial information, computer code or customer databases. Contractual agreements such as Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs). How is information classified? There are many approaches to classifying information, such as the UK Government Classification System , but typically the most common information classification labels are public, confidential, commercial, sensitive and personal. Methods to protect valuable information will normally include a combination of technology, people, and process controls. So, what are we trying to protect?

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy The “Soft” Side of Cybercrime By Becky Davies – CYSIAM Consultant It turns out, the ‘new’ world of social engineering isn’t so new anymore. It’s become a house-hold term, represented in film, marketing and sales among other mediums. With phishing being the second most popular attack vector for hackers in 2021, as well as one of the costliest to recover from [i] no wonder it’s a hacker’s best friend. The cost to set up a social engineering attack is low, the risk is even lower, whilst the potential pay-out is huge. What makes these attacks so successful is the underpinning use of psychology. In some ways social engineers use tricks and manipulation to better their cause, but more fundamentally, they are wielding well-honed social savvy, known human errors and influence to cue into how people will think, feel and react. This is what separates the good, the bad and the ugly in phishing attacks. The “click here” emails without any context, sent by a mystery Prince will most likely result in a press of the delete button, but by using a few simple psychology techniques such as developing a pre-text (“please fill in this quick survey about your current understanding of quality management”), context (“to help us gauge knowledge levels”), scarcity (“the survey will expire in ten minutes”) and authority (“signed, Head of Quality), a hackers click rate is bound to be higher. Closely related to influence and psychology is a behavioural science concept that helps us make sense of some of the complexities of human behaviour and how people come to decisions. Daniel Kahneman writes about a process of ‘thinking fast and slow’[ii] otherwise known as System 1 and System 2 thinking. Put simply, it’s the distinction between automatic and deliberate thought processes: System 1 is the brain’s fast, automatic, and intuitive approach. Normally influenced by emotions and instinct, system one activity includes answering simple maths questions, i.e. 2 + 2 = 4 or those impulse buys on a whim. System 2 is the minds slower, analytical mode where reason dominates. It is activated when we require concentration or some mental exertion. Now, I’m not suggesting every hacker has a degree in psychology or behavioural science, but they can be known to take advantage of these systems, without even realising themselves. Those phishing emails pertaining to be your boss who is in “urgent need of help” and just so happens to misplace your mobile number evokes feelings of urgency, resulting in quick system one thinking and your number being sent. Similarly, that email stating that a “dog has been injured in the car park, who’s is it…please find picture attached” not only plays right into system one by inducing an immediate emotional reaction, but also into humans’ natural empathy. So, how do you protect yourself and your business? Engage system two. Opposite to the popular saying, think first, act later… Peel back that veil of trust you may have for everything that lands in your inbox and check your source – that email address might be something nefarious behind the display name. If you can utilise another method of communication to contact the person being impersonated, do! Get a colleague’s opinion on it (although please don’t go around forwarding malware). And if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is! Looking at the wider picture, psychology and social engineering are so intertwined, yet many businesses seem to neglect their biggest vulnerability, people, in favour for technological solutions. If your employees understand how humans make decisions, they can start to process how a malicious actor can use psychological principles, cognitive biases, and the art of social engineering to get them to take an action that is not in their best interest[iii]. Courses, internal training, even simple reminders that phishing can come in all sorts of mediums with varying messages should help to defend against the human hacker. After all, knowledge is power.

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy 6 Lessons Learnt in Incident Response By Sean O’Connor – Principal Consultant We’ve learnt a few lessons during our emergency incident response over the last few years. Spoiler alert – these are not the sexy zero days of Hollywood. The basics done well are still the best defence against cyber-attacks. Below are 6 common and easy to implement steps that will increase your chance of success during an incident: Audit and remove unnecessary admin accounts Test your backups Have an incident response partner you can call in an emergency Identify and store all necessary security logs Establish a communications channel with your Anti-Virus (AV) provider Train your IT team to preserve evidence and have confidence to provide immediate support during an attack Forgotten but Active Admins: During an investigation, we often find unused admin accounts. Historical admins that have a weak password, originally used for a specific purpose many moons ago, still lurking, waiting to be abused by threat actors. Chances are, those admin accounts aren’t monitored by anyone and when one starts to get used, no one is aware. We commonly hear; “oh that’s for an old supplier or a general use admin account, but we haven’t used it in years”. Unfortunately for the victim, that old admin had been used to maintain persistence and ultimately deploy ransomware across their network. It is important to regularly conduct reviews of your Admin accounts and delete the accounts no longer required. Additionally, if a new service or supplier requires admin privileges to your network, you should have a process to question why, and formally approve or reject the request. If granted, ensure that the least privileges possible are permitted and monitor the accounts. Backup Restore Testing: Most organisations have a backup solution in place. Backups in a disaster recovery scenario or an incident involving ransomware are critical. One of the very first things we ask during the earliest stages of an incident is ‘are the backups secured’? Most backup software will show green for completed, but very few will let you know if there is any corruption, or if malware has been backed up. If you are hoarding years of files, emails and other “business critical” information, then your recovery time could be very long, or not at all if corrupted. If your backup is in the cloud – do you know how long will this take to download?! Conducting regular backup restore checks will allow the IT team to get a realistic recovery timeline for your systems and check for corruption. Following the 3-2-1 principle will create layers of resilience: 3 backups, on 2 types of media, with 1 of those being offsite. Early engagement of an Incident Response Team (IRT): Every Friday afternoon, from around 1500, the CYSIAM IRT sit expecting a call from a company in desperate need of support, with an incident that the IT Team has been working on, usually for a few days but in some cases, a bit longer. The frustration from an IRT perspective is that when we are finally able to get on task, vital evidence has been deleted or modified. By starting remediation before consulting experts, the victim company can inadvertently remove the ability for investigators to identify how the threat actor gained entry to the network and identify the root cause of the incident. Having an effective incident response plan, linked directly to the BC plan, plus having an expert incident response team that can be called in an emergency will reduce the time to recovery and ultimately save the business money. Insufficient Logging: No matter the IRT you employ, they are bound to ask for the logs of your network. The logs CYSIAM require are mainly windows event logs, syslogs and firewall logs however, there are many more that could be useful. The IRT will need this data as it provides a rich source of potential evidence on how the attacker gained entry to the network and what they did once they had access. Therefore, having limited or no logging in your environment seriously impacts the ability of the IRT to conduct analysis of the incident, and may even result in the root cause not being established. In addition to collecting logs, having those logs forwarded to a central logging server will speed up recovery from the incident. Also, having your logging server on a different OS will further increase resilience in the event of a ransomware attack. AV Solution Contact: Every organisation large or small has a traditional Anti-Virus (AV) solution that will block or remove any known malware. During an incident, it’s likely that the malware that has infected your environment has not been picked up by AV because it doesn’t have a signature. Attackers can cleverly bypass traditional AV by changing the malware slightly. Once the malware has been found, it needs to be eradicated from the network. One way to speed up this process is to utilise your current AV solution to scan and remove the malware. This may require additional support from the AV vendor. Understanding how to contact your vendor and the time it will take for them to release a signature update for the new malware is important to the eradication and recovery stages of incident response. Training for the IT Team: IT support teams are often the first on scene for a cyber incident. The immediate actions of the IT Team can impact how the event is handled and ultimately set up the organisation to succeed or fail with a cyber incident. Having a defined set of immediate actions for frontline IT support personnel is a development step we always take with our clients when preparing them for incident response. Developing incident playbooks, including scenarios in the business continuity plan and exercising the business regularly will give the IT team the confidence to be the first responders when the worst happens. Learning and implementing these lessons will help mitigate against a cyber-attack and increase your chances of success against a threat actor. Although they may be considered ‘basic’, first-hand experience has shown that the basics done right give companies the greatest chance of getting back to business-as-usual status, as soon as possible.

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Success Is Built On Shared Values By Sarah Hales – CYSIAM Operations Manager When the pandemic hit, CYSIAM were already fortunate enough to have a distributed operating model that consisted of employees located across the country working remotely to support our clients. All with different roles, different skills, different interests, and even different accents. However, the one thing I have learnt as Operations Manager is that we all hold the same values and share a common goal; a genuine desire to help organisations and people to protect themselves from cyber-attacks. Identifying your company’s core values means you can better define the company culture – your greater mission and reasons for operating as a company, beyond the tangible products or services you may offer. [i] CYSIAM’s culture has been built on honour, intuition, resolution, mastery and an expeditionary mindset: As a company, we have always been output focussed. Presenteeism and clock watching is just not the CYSIAM way. We are honourable as a team and individuals, trusted by our colleagues to deliver on time and to a high standard. We remain intuitive , staying ahead of the ever-evolving threats, solution orientated focussed and always put our clients at the heart of what we do. Resolute and poised to react, we are determined to solve problems and always have our clients’ and our team’s backs. We are masterful but continue to be curious, learn and adapt. Our staff are currently studying master’s degrees, learning on the job to pass exams, mentoring others and developing themselves. Whether our teams are heading to Middlesborough or the Middle East at short notice, we are not scared to be expeditionary and venture into every horizon to help our clients. These five values are sewn into our fabric and by using them to make decisions, we make a deliberate choice to focus on what is important to us and consequently build internal cohesion within the team. Managing a distributed team whilst working from home can be challenging for any new operations manager, but CYSIAM has taught me that if you build the right culture, driven by your values, not only do your team benefit, but clients do too. This is especially relevant when it comes to our emergency cyber security incident response team (CSIRT). In the event of a cyber incident, every minute matters. Having the CYSIAM team located across all corners of the country, means that we can deploy our cyber first responders on the ground quickly to take control of incidents such as cyber-attacks, data breaches and system failures. The rest of the team support remotely with the shared desire to remove the threat in a timely fashion. For our clients, operational downtime is minimised and further risks of attacks reduced.

All with different roles, different skills, different interests, and even different accents. However, the one thing I have learnt as Operations Manager is that we all hold the same values and share a common goal; a genuine desire to help organisations and people to protect themselves from cyber-attacks. Identifying your company’s core values means you can better define the company culture – your greater mission and reasons for operating as a company, beyond the tangible products or services you may offer. [i] CYSIAM’s culture has been built on honour, intuition, resolution, mastery and an expeditionary mindset: As a company, we have always been output focussed. Presenteeism and clock watching is just not the CYSIAM way. We are honourable as a team and individuals, trusted by our colleagues to deliver on time and to a high standard. We remain intuitive , staying ahead of the ever-evolving threats, solution orientated focussed and always put our clients at the heart of what we do. Resolute and poised to react, we are determined to solve problems and always have our clients’ and our team’s backs. We are masterful but continue to be curious, learn and adapt. Our staff are currently studying master’s degrees, learning on the job to pass exams, mentoring others and developing themselves. Whether our teams are heading to Middlesborough or the Middle East at short notice, we are not scared to be expeditionary and venture into every horizon to help our clients. These five values are sewn into our fabric and by using them to make decisions, we make a deliberate choice to focus on what is important to us and consequently build internal cohesion within the team. Managing a distributed team whilst working from home can be challenging for any new operations manager, but CYSIAM has taught me that if you build the right culture, driven by your values, not only do your team benefit, but clients do too. This is especially relevant when it comes to our emergency cyber security incident response team (CSIRT). In the event of a cyber incident, every minute matters. Having the CYSIAM team located across all corners of the country, means that we can deploy our cyber first responders on the ground quickly to take control of incidents such as cyber-attacks, data breaches and system failures. The rest of the team support remotely with the shared desire to remove the threat in a timely fashion. For our clients, operational downtime is minimised and further risks of attacks reduced. A distributed CYSIAM team, working remotely and driven by our shared values to provide reassurance and support to our clients no matter the time or day – it’s awesome to be a part of. I am lucky to work with such talented, humble and motivated individuals and I would welcome applicants and associates who resonate with our culture and want to be part of a formidable (and distributed) team.

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy The Threat: BlackMatter By Jack Lea – Senior Technical Consultant In the aftermath of the ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline in May 2021 that crippled the US transport and energy infrastructure, owners of Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) groups ran for the hills. US and/or Russian law enforcement had taken swift action to dissuade and punish ransomware threat actors. Realising they had bitten off more than they could chew, DarkSide – the RaaS responsible for the pipeline attack – immediately ceased operations and freely offered decryption tools to their victims as their infrastructure was dismantled by an unconfirmed law enforcement agency[i]. Babuk , another RaaS, stepped away from the ransomware spotlight to concentrate on data-theft extortion instead, claiming to have handed over their source code to another team[ii]. Popular Russian-speaking cybercrime forums – XSS , Raid and Exploit – announced that they would no longer harbour discussion threads related to ransomware schemes and recruitment. And finally, after REvil had unleashed chaos by attacking Kaseya’s remote management software, they too went to ground – suspending their data leak blogsite and payment portal (albeit, temporarily). But in this withdrawal, arose a new player – BlackMatter . Wasting no time at all, BlackMatter (BM) boldly stated in their first post that they would be seeking targets with a revenue of at least $100M, in English speaking countries, with networks consisting of 500 – 15,000 hosts. Large companies with large amounts of cash at stake. (Source: The Record) – BlackMatter’s account on Exploit Forum According to the threat actor’s public blog, the ransomware group had built in “the best features of DarkSide, REvil and LockBit”. This was later expanded upon in an interview by Dmitry Smilyanets of Recorded Future and a spokesperson of BM[iii]. BM stated that they had improved upon REvil’s ‘SafeMode’, adding that it had been “weak and not well thought out”. They took parts from LockBit’s “implementation of the codebase” and “borrowed the structure of the admin panel” from DarkSide. Though highly targeted ransomware attacks do occur, the main goal of most RaaS operators is profit. This means the initial stage of an attack will likely involve widespread scanning and exploitation of server-side vulnerabilities, watering hole attacks, exploit kits or even spam campaigns. The main objective of BM is to encrypt the victim’s data and hold it to ransom. According to CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency), once the BM ransomware reaches a target machine, it uses previously compromised embedded credentials to enumerate all running processes and services and then uses the LDAP and SMB protocols to access the Active Directory and discover all hosts on the network. BM then leverages the embedded credentials and SMB to remotely encrypt all hosts and shared drives as they are discovered. (Source: Twitter @rivitna2) – Screenshot of BlackMatter’s ransom note The threat actor states in their website that they abide by a set of rules; not to attack hospitals, oil and gas, critical infrastructure, defence, NGO’s and governments. A measure to avoid the ever-increasing vigilance of law enforcement over critical infrastructure. These rules are likely to be in response to President Biden’s announcement in June where he spoke of 16 sectors that should be “off limits” to cyberattacks. However, it appears these rules are being loosely followed – if at all – as a recent attack by BM has left an Iowa-based farming services provider incapacitated and ransomed for $5.9M. New Cooperative provides farming technology and software platforms to mainly grain farmers, a service that is considered critical to the US food supply chain. It could be argued that BM are technically following their own rules, as they have only identified power plants and water treatment facilities as critical infrastructure under their definition. Nonetheless, a definition highly criticised. (Source: Twitter) – Screenshot of New Cooperative and BM’s conversation For a ransomware group that is no more than 4 months old, they have been involved in several highly publicised cyberattacks. These are just the incidents that have managed to reach the headlines and appear on their own data-leak site. The number of attacks that are currently underway or have already been settled privately could be far higher. If the group truly is a descendant of DarkSide, it is reasonable to expect far more from them in the coming years. All is not lost though, CYSIAM have put together a list of mitigations that businesses can implement to reduce the risk of ransomware attacks. Protect Important Folders with Controlled Folder Access[iv] – Controlled Folder Access protects data by checking access request of applications against a list of trusted and known apps. Strong Password Controls and Password Managers – Demand all accounts (e.g admin, service accounts etc) have strong and unique passwords. To ensure passwords are not reused across the enterprise, incorporate password managers to create and retain credentials. Enable MFA for all services where possible. Especially accounts with access to critical systems. Use an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solution – EDR detects malicious processes that have started to run on the endpoint and can automatically respond by blocking the process. Implement a robust and tested Backup and Disaster Recovery plan, including adopting the 3-2-1 Backup Strategy – 3 copies of the data exist (1 original, 2 are backups) 2 copies are kept on different media (cloud, NAS) 1 of the copies is kept offline and offsite Implement effective policies and procedures that incorporate playbooks which align with staff awareness training.

US and/or Russian law enforcement had taken swift action to dissuade and punish ransomware threat actors. Realising they had bitten off more than they could chew, DarkSide – the RaaS responsible for the pipeline attack – immediately ceased operations and freely offered decryption tools to their victims as their infrastructure was dismantled by an unconfirmed law enforcement agency[i]. Babuk , another RaaS, stepped away from the ransomware spotlight to concentrate on data-theft extortion instead, claiming to have handed over their source code to another team[ii]. Popular Russian-speaking cybercrime forums – XSS , Raid and Exploit – announced that they would no longer harbour discussion threads related to ransomware schemes and recruitment. And finally, after REvil had unleashed chaos by attacking Kaseya’s remote management software, they too went to ground – suspending their data leak blogsite and payment portal (albeit, temporarily). But in this withdrawal, arose a new player – BlackMatter . Wasting no time at all, BlackMatter (BM) boldly stated in their first post that they would be seeking targets with a revenue of at least $100M, in English speaking countries, with networks consisting of 500 – 15,000 hosts. Large companies with large amounts of cash at stake. (Source: The Record) – BlackMatter’s account on Exploit Forum According to the threat actor’s public blog, the ransomware group had built in “the best features of DarkSide, REvil and LockBit”. This was later expanded upon in an interview by Dmitry Smilyanets of Recorded Future and a spokesperson of BM[iii]. BM stated that they had improved upon REvil’s ‘SafeMode’, adding that it had been “weak and not well thought out”. They took parts from LockBit’s “implementation of the codebase” and “borrowed the structure of the admin panel” from DarkSide. Though highly targeted ransomware attacks do occur, the main goal of most RaaS operators is profit. This means the initial stage of an attack will likely involve widespread scanning and exploitation of server-side vulnerabilities, watering hole attacks, exploit kits or even spam campaigns. The main objective of BM is to encrypt the victim’s data and hold it to ransom. According to CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency), once the BM ransomware reaches a target machine, it uses previously compromised embedded credentials to enumerate all running processes and services and then uses the LDAP and SMB protocols to access the Active Directory and discover all hosts on the network. BM then leverages the embedded credentials and SMB to remotely encrypt all hosts and shared drives as they are discovered. (Source: Twitter @rivitna2) – Screenshot of BlackMatter’s ransom note The threat actor states in their website that they abide by a set of rules; not to attack hospitals, oil and gas, critical infrastructure, defence, NGO’s and governments. A measure to avoid the ever-increasing vigilance of law enforcement over critical infrastructure. These rules are likely to be in response to President Biden’s announcement in June where he spoke of 16 sectors that should be “off limits” to cyberattacks. However, it appears these rules are being loosely followed – if at all – as a recent attack by BM has left an Iowa-based farming services provider incapacitated and ransomed for $5.9M. New Cooperative provides farming technology and software platforms to mainly grain farmers, a service that is considered critical to the US food supply chain. It could be argued that BM are technically following their own rules, as they have only identified power plants and water treatment facilities as critical infrastructure under their definition. Nonetheless, a definition highly criticised. (Source: Twitter) – Screenshot of New Cooperative and BM’s conversation For a ransomware group that is no more than 4 months old, they have been involved in several highly publicised cyberattacks. These are just the incidents that have managed to reach the headlines and appear on their own data-leak site.

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Did I Lock The Door? By Matt Cole – Senior Technical Consultant How many times have you left the house, and then 10 minutes later, you’ve wondered if you locked the door or not? Most of the time, you have, and your house is relatively safe, but it’s quite often the first thing you consider when worrying about your security. The same could be said for a system or an account. Did you remember to lock your device, or log out from your online account? Of course, this does make access for a criminal more difficult, but in a digital age where everything is online, we must consider more than just whether we have preventative measures such as locks, or restricted access. Perhaps another question we should be asking is, “Am I accidentally giving away my keys?”. The information we share online always seems so innocent because it is normally such a minute detail that no-one could possibly use it maliciously. A picture of a dog, a running route on a fitness app, or membership of an online community. The problem comes when all this information is collected, processed, and analysed. This is called Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT), an intelligence discipline using information gained from public sources, which is then analysed to satisfy a certain requirement. This can be something legitimate such as due diligence, or nefarious such as gaining access to someone’s workplace, or online account. Consider a scenario where someone has just joined a new company. They post a picture of themselves in the new office, with a job title of System Administrator, and the post has a comment from a manager saying, “welcome to the team.” This is a relatively common example and can provide a lot of ammunition for a potential attacker. For example, the attacker could take note of the manager’s name, use an open-source tool to work out the company’s email address format, create a similar looking email address with the manager’s name, and then send an email to the new employee asking for personal information. This is called a spear phishing attack and does not take much time to be set up and executed convincingly. Due to the fact the employee is new, they might not yet be aware of the company’s culture and communication style, and assume it is from the manager. Another piece of information could be the job title itself. In this example, the job title, System Administrator, could lead a hacker towards exploiting a vulnerability of a certain software or hardware that the company may be using, and when cross referenced with the employee’s qualifications and experience, the search is narrowed. It could also be used alongside other OSINT techniques such as researching their geolocation activity on fitness apps, to craft a very convincing spear phishing attack against another employee. They would be an ideal target for hackers to impersonate due to their critical role within the organisation, creating a natural sense of authority and trust from those receiving communication from them. The point of this is not to say stop sharing content. Communication via the internet has opened the world, forged new connections, maintained relationships that would otherwise have dissolved, brought many benefits, and has launched us into a digital era. However, in this new era, it is best practice to limit what you share where possible, and to limit the recipients of your content to those that you trust. Once it is on the internet, we should assume that everyone in the world can see it, even after it is deleted, also that someone out there will want to use it maliciously. Social media, geolocation, avatars, and usernames are relatively new concepts, and we must consider their impact on security as equal to those physical or preventative measures we’re so used to.

They would be an ideal target for hackers to impersonate due to their critical role within the organisation, creating a natural sense of authority and trust from those receiving communication from them. The point of this is not to say stop sharing content. Communication via the internet has opened the world, forged new connections, maintained relationships that would otherwise have dissolved, brought many benefits, and has launched us into a digital era. However, in this new era, it is best practice to limit what you share where possible, and to limit the recipients of your content to those that you trust. Once it is on the internet, we should assume that everyone in the world can see it, even after it is deleted, also that someone out there will want to use it maliciously. Social media, geolocation, avatars, and usernames are relatively new concepts, and we must consider their impact on security as equal to those physical or preventative measures we’re so used to.

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Cyber Capacity Building 101 By Stacey Lidgate – CYSIAM Head of Consulting The term ‘cyber capacity building’ gets used across a lot of companies and consultancies these days, but what do we mean when we talk about it? For CYSIAM, it’s about helping individuals, teams, organisations and countries achieve a sustainable step change in their cyber defences to secure their cyberspace and reduce the impact of cybercrime and cyber threats. Why is it important? Digitisation is growing at an exponential pace, with countries and organisations across the globe becoming more and more dependent upon technology to operate and survive. But it’s a double-edged sword; for every advantage and efficiency delivered from digital ways of working, cyber security risks and attack opportunities emerge. The United Kingdom Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) explain that “in an increasingly connected world, in which we all share the same cyberspace, improvements in cybersecurity are never zero-sum”.[1] Cybersecurity threats and cybercrime are borderless, so working to better global cybersecurity levels is of benefit to everyone. For some countries, increased cyber capacity is essential because progress and development of their economy and society is dependent on stronger cybersecurity. How do we approach it? The CYSIAM team have experience of delivering cyber capacity building in some of the most complex and unstable parts of the world. We combine leadership and diplomacy skills with deep technical knowledge and our backgrounds range from academia and military to central government. It’s because of our decades of experience that we know that secure digital transformation is never just about technology. We understand the critical interdependencies between people, culture, information, data, policy, supply chains, governance and physical environments and strive to build effective and trusted relationships with every team we encounter. We approach cyber capacity building as a critical friend and trusted partner and try to focus on three key areas throughout any assignment: Understand the problem: Collaborative problem solving is one of the most rewarding aspects of working in cyber capacity building. We work side-by-side with our clients to understand their inner mechanics and help them identify the root of the problems they face. Design effective projects: There is no ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach to cyber capacity building – every country, organisation, team and problem is different. Improving cybersecurity capabilities might require a mix of skills to deliver anything from short training courses, ongoing mentoring, strategy design or a multi-year programme that concurrently develops cyber security teams, implements new equipment and redesigns ways of working. It’s never about telling clients why our way is best, or striving for unattainable standards, but about drawing on our experiences to design approaches Assure and evaluate: We make sure that benefits are considered from the very beginning of a project and that mechanisms are put in place to assess how they are being delivered and realised. Assuring sustainability of what we deliver is also critical and our approach always keeps long-term changes in mind. What types of things are we involved in? We were appointed as an Implementing Partner of the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise (GFCE) in 2019 and today are working on several cyber capacity building projects across Asia, South-East Asia, the Middle East, South America, Scandinavia, Central, East and South Africa to deliver: Digital forensics training and mentoring for technical staff, police officers and prosecutors. Design of National Cyber Incident Response Strategies. Design of National Cyber Incident Response processes and mentoring across incident response teams. Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) training and mentoring for specialist police cybercrime investigators. Design and delivery of a multi-year secure digital transformation programme for a critical central government department. Specialist equipment design and training. Cyber threat intelligence assessments, training and mentoring for a National Government. Intrusion detection training and mentoring for specialist police cybercrime investigators. Over the coming months we’ll expand more on our experiences, what we think contributes to successful cyber capacity building and explain more about some of the projects we have been involved in and how they have made a difference.

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy I’m The Creeper, Catch Me If You Can By Adam Boad – CYSIAM Consultant It’s been 50 years since what most experts agree was the world’s first worm. Although created with no malicious intent, ‘The Creeper’, created by Bob Thomas in 1971, was a piece of self-replicating code that gained access via the ARPANET to affect all mainframe computers running the TENEX operating system. As new technologies and software are created, malicious code will only ever be one step behind. Throughout the 1970’s and 80’s, the damage done by malware was mostly localised, as use of computers and the internet was restricted to a limited number of academics and businesses. Progressing through the 1980’s, more significant pieces of malware were created, not just in terms of damage caused but also in respect of media recognition. In 1988, the Morris worm, so called due to its creator, Robert Morris, resulted in the first criminal conviction under the United States 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The 1990’s saw the first hugely significant increase in the use of the internet, due to its availability publicly. Rapid expansion in the number of emails being sent inevitably meant email-based malware wasn’t far behind. One of the most famous email based worms, the ILOVEYOU worm which would be sent as an attachment, used early social engineering techniques to disguise itself as a love letter for unsuspecting romantic hopefuls. ILOVEYOU would then propagate amongst the user’s files sending copies of itself to the infected users contact list. The noughties saw a big rise in the use of financial service trojans; in particular, Zeus, or zbot. The malware would be used to log keystrokes of the victim, leading to the stealing of their credentials including, but not limited to their bank details. To this day, Zeus is still seen re-appearing across the internet. Malware has evolved into an increasing threat to individuals and businesses alike, with ransomware like Cryptolocker in 2013 laying down the gauntlet for ransomware gangs to follow. Famously reported, the WannaCry cryptoworm attack in 2017, which infected over 200,000 computers in the space of less than 8 hours, including devices owned by the NHS in the UK, is an example of how threat actors can also be a nation state. Malware is a constant, ever evolving threat internationally, with cyber security incidents caused by malware on an upward trend. All is not lost though, there are practical, easy to implement practices businesses of all sizes can execute to prepare and defend themselves against an attack. Some may include: Backing up your data – As ransomware is ever more accessible to malicious actors, knowing you have a failsafe for your critical data should be of paramount importance. Confirming your backups are accessible for when you need them is a common oversight, while maintaining backups in more than one location provides an extra layer of defence. Train your employees – Staff training to identify, avoid and report social engineered phishing attempts. Monitor and reduce your attack surface – Ensuring your critical assets are constantly updated and monitored will help to provide a robust defence against a breach. Furthermore, reducing your attack surface limits opportunities for initial compromise, while also limiting vectors for movement within your network. Policy Implementation – Following security best practises in devising thorough risk management strategies and policies. Also ensuring they are updated in line with new types of attacks and malware. In short, understanding how malicious software might be disguised, by potentially looking back at previous malware exfiltration’s may go a long way in protecting you from attacks. As new malware is created, it’s important to stay vigilant; implementing the four steps above will help you stay in front of the malware threat.

Although created with no malicious intent, ‘The Creeper’, created by Bob Thomas in 1971, was a piece of self-replicating code that gained access via the ARPANET to affect all mainframe computers running the TENEX operating system. As new technologies and software are created, malicious code will only ever be one step behind. Throughout the 1970’s and 80’s, the damage done by malware was mostly localised, as use of computers and the internet was restricted to a limited number of academics and businesses. Progressing through the 1980’s, more significant pieces of malware were created, not just in terms of damage caused but also in respect of media recognition. In 1988, the Morris worm, so called due to its creator, Robert Morris, resulted in the first criminal conviction under the United States 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The 1990’s saw the first hugely significant increase in the use of the internet, due to its availability publicly. Rapid expansion in the number of emails being sent inevitably meant email-based malware wasn’t far behind. One of the most famous email based worms, the ILOVEYOU worm which would be sent as an attachment, used early social engineering techniques to disguise itself as a love letter for unsuspecting romantic hopefuls. ILOVEYOU would then propagate amongst the user’s files sending copies of itself to the infected users contact list. The noughties saw a big rise in the use of financial service trojans; in particular, Zeus, or zbot. The malware would be used to log keystrokes of the victim, leading to the stealing of their credentials including, but not limited to their bank details. To this day, Zeus is still seen re-appearing across the internet. Malware has evolved into an increasing threat to individuals and businesses alike, with ransomware like Cryptolocker in 2013 laying down the gauntlet for ransomware gangs to follow. Famously reported, the WannaCry cryptoworm attack in 2017, which infected over 200,000 computers in the space of less than 8 hours, including devices owned by the NHS in the UK, is an example of how threat actors can also be a nation state. Malware is a constant, ever evolving threat internationally, with cyber security incidents caused by malware on an upward trend. All is not lost though, there are practical, easy to implement practices businesses of all sizes can execute to prepare and defend themselves against an attack. Some may include: Backing up your data – As ransomware is ever more accessible to malicious actors, knowing you have a failsafe for your critical data should be of paramount importance. Confirming your backups are accessible for when you need them is a common oversight, while maintaining backups in more than one location provides an extra layer of defence. Train your employees – Staff training to identify, avoid and report social engineered phishing attempts. Monitor and reduce your attack surface – Ensuring your critical assets are constantly updated and monitored will help to provide a robust defence against a breach. Furthermore, reducing your attack surface limits opportunities for initial compromise, while also limiting vectors for movement within your network. Policy Implementation – Following security best practises in devising thorough risk management strategies and policies. Also ensuring they are updated in line with new types of attacks and malware. In short, understanding how malicious software might be disguised, by potentially looking back at previous malware exfiltration’s may go a long way in protecting you from attacks. As new malware is created, it’s important to stay vigilant; implementing the four steps above will help you stay in front of the malware threat.

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Rules to Remember: Being a Start-Up’s MD By David Allan – CYSIAM MD & CTO So, what’s it really like to be the managing director of a small start-up company? Well, it’s been a lot of things; challenging, demanding, rewarding, eye-opening, to name a few and I’m sure other MD’s can agree with me on this. In the style of the film Zombieland, I’ve decided to share a few rules I would tell my younger self and maybe help a few others along the way…. Rule number 1: Create the pressure to succeed & use good stress to your advantage Growing a business is a privilege; you are directly contributing to the economy in a very tangible way. Creating jobs, paying taxes and most importantly, providing the platform for talented people to develop into amazing professionals. However, it is also stressful. We’ve started from scratch, with no investment, running a business without any sales, marketing, HR or finance team. You do everything. You find the clients, deliver the pitch, get knocked back, find another one, write proposals, win some work, relax for 5 minutes then go again, day in day out. At the same time, you are looking for new recruits, trying to manage resources, proofread reports, design marketing materials, attend conferences, keep an eye on quality and so on, so on. In the early days, you simultaneously need to be focussing on the minute details and looking at the big picture; strategically, where is the business going? It sounds stressful even recalling it, but one of the best things I have done was use that pressure and stress positively to drive CYSIAM forward to where we are today. If you have no pressure to succeed, are you really going to be as hungry for the next step? Rule number 2: Embrace your responsibility I’m not necessarily talking about job titles here, after all, my job role goes beyond the title of MD and CTO. But instead, starting a business and recruiting our first employee is where the dynamic changes from essentially being self-employed and only worrying about yourself, to feeling real responsibility for the organisation that you are building. You now have members of staff that have families to feed and are depending on the business to provide them with the means of doing so. Instead of shying away from this responsibility, embrace the accountability and use it to forge ahead. Rule number 3: Ask for help from everyone and as much as you need to Our industry is full of amazing people that are always keen to help, from technical problems to routine HR queries, finding people that you can talk to that are also independent from your business is key. Honesty is the best policy. Rule number 4: Surround yourself with awesome people! Firstly, starting and running a business is tough, throw in a global pandemic and it becomes tougher. We’ve built an amazing team at CYSIAM meaning a hard job is made much easier with the truly talented people we have in the business. So, I’d urge everyone to connect, construct and invest in their teams so that challenges, including fully remote working, are negligible. Rule number 5: Enjoy the journey I expect the current growing pains will get easier as we expand and bring in more overhead resource and expertise, but even as CYSIAM develops into an international powerhouse (fingers crossed), I’ll be very grateful for the first few years’ experience and I’m sure we’ll look back on this as the ‘fun’ bit.

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Cyber Due Diligence: The New Normal In all likelihood, cyber security capabilities will continue to lag behind both evolving digital technology and the accompanying evolution in exploitation tools and techniques. In addition, network defenders are required to stop every attack whilst hostile states, criminals and activists need only get lucky once. Technology is already ubiquitous, think how many times you have interacted with a computer today – contactless payments, your phone, vending machines, even your car. With the rate that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are developing it won’t be long before we are all connected in almost every aspect of our lives and technology will blend seamlessly with our work and recreation. With this exponential growth in connectivity and with ever more details of our lives stored and shared online, the cyber threat has grown from what used to be one of inconvenience and occasional extortion. It is now a big business opportunity for criminals, a method of warfare for nation states and a powerful political messaging platform for activists. All of these actors (and more) present a potential threat and may have an interest in disrupting your business and/or personal online activities. Just take a few seconds to think about how your business would cope without access to your critical functions or data for a day? A week? A month? Bearing all this in mind, why do we continue to embrace the digital revolution at the rate we are, whilst dragging our feet in implementing often the most basic security controls? In our home lives, we give more personal data to Google than we’d share with our closest friends, and watch on as our families share their lives via social media. In business, we believe that an attack won’t happen, or if it does then it won’t be that bad. Companies may only really consider their cyber security approach in detail during an attack, at which point it becomes expensive and disruptive to fix – try installing a fire alarm during a fire! Why don’t we give our cyber security the attention it deserves? The answers may be ironically similar to the reasons we are drawn to these technologies in the first place. Performance: “it will slow us down” Costs: “we can’t afford the investment” Availability: “too much downtime” Convenience: “our workforce won’t like it” Typically, as 21st century human beings, we like to have our cake and eat it. We want all of the benefits that this incredible technology brings us without tolerating the controls that we need to use it safely and responsibly. That’s a sweeping statement of course, but in order to counter this issue the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) here in the UK and similar organisations around the world are working hard to encourage change and education for all. Progress is happening, but there’s a long way to go in bringing us collectively to the minimum required standard and keeping us there. What should be the minimum standard? We’re still hearing from executive-level employees “our I.T. people have got that covered” and “we’ve got Cyber Essentials so we’re ok”. There’s nothing inherently wrong with either of these statements provided that they are in the right context. A good quality I.T. team is vital to cyber security and Cyber Essentials self-accreditation is a sign that an organisation takes cyber security seriously. The same statements though could also be an indicator of box-ticking by a board which is yet to give the cyber threat to their business the respect it deserves. Boards shouldn’t wait until their share price has plummeted because of a devastating cyber attack before making cyber security a board-level issue. We’ve spent many years working in secure environments, some within industry giants, and some within government facilities. In these specialist areas, for most of those years the security provisions in place have been successful and largely commensurate with the threat. Of course there have been exceptions and mistakes made, but a culture of security was ingrained into our organisations and people understood why. The workforce conformed willingly because at the heart of this culture secrets needed to be kept and lives were potentially at stake. Well, in this digital age where data is now competing with cash for the title of King, autonomous transport is on our doorstep, and our critical national infrastructure is at risk of attack, the same approach to the cyber threat could and should be embedded. So the minimum standard must be a collaboration of controls, understanding and culture which provides robust layers of defence against both external and internal threats. It must also be versatile, dynamic and informative enough to evolve with the threat. It must extend to incident response and recovery, to ensure that plans are in place and people understand their roles and responsibilities in case the worst happens. This should now be the minimum standard against which commercial organisations comply. If we don’t accelerate wider conformity to this minimum criteria very soon, then technology will take another ‘quantum’ leap forward leaving honest and law-abiding users even further behind. The new normal The NCSC has published their ’10 steps to Cyber Security’ and ‘Cyber Assessment Framework’. The equivalent Australian agency has ‘The Essential Eight’ and the US the ‘NIST Cybersecurity Framework’. There is plenty of guidance available, but to have any affect it takes the will and intent of investors, owners, executives and employees to implement this guidance. Cyber Essentials, Cyber Essentials Plus and ISO27001 are a good start in terms of accreditation, however they don’t necessarily provide assurance that security measures are sufficient for the specific environment of a particular organisation. At the time of writing there is no substitute for a professional, independent evaluation. In all probability an international standard will eventually emerge from the guidance which will require conformity to a ‘new normal’ especially in certain circumstances, such as when an organisation applies for cyber insurance. This ‘new normal’ will likely be the kind of cyber security culture and approach that the international defence and intelligence communities have complied with for many years. For investors, whether it be a potential acquisition or an existing portfolio, the question is whether you can afford to wait for a new standard to become commonplace and adopted or whether you take a more proactive approach. We would strongly recommend that, if you haven’t already, you start to undertake cyber due diligence now against the baseline of ‘the new normal’ which has been laid out in detailed non-mandatory guidance by the UK government. Just rolling out the I.T. Manager or ticking a box against CE, CE+ or ISO27001 isn’t enough for you anymore. To satisfy you and your investors that you have identified and negotiated ownership of all cyber risk in your existing and potential portfolio, a comprehensive cyber due diligence review should be conducted. For owners and boards of businesses or organisations, the sooner you do the same and undertake a full due diligence review the sooner you will understand your risks and resilience to a threat which is only going to grow. This ‘new normal’ in security doesn’t necessarily require expensive software or infrastructure. What it does mean is that things might be a little bit less convenient, a tad slower, and your employees might complain initially about some of the restrictions. However, with commitment to cultural as well as technology change and a common set of consequence-led objectives you will adapt and be a stronger organisation as a result. The rate of cyber-attacks has remained high in the UK for the last two years despite best efforts. The average financial impact of these attacks has increased by 400% in the same time period. This is in spite of some excellent work, particularly in the UK, to reduce the frequency and impact of cyber-attacks. Don’t wait to find out the hard way that what is currently accepted as ‘normal’ is not good enough. This is cultural, technological and business change. We must do more and keep doing more.

The NCSC has published their ’10 steps to Cyber Security’ and ‘Cyber Assessment Framework’. The equivalent Australian agency has ‘The Essential Eight’ and the US the ‘NIST Cybersecurity Framework’. There is plenty of guidance available, but to have any affect it takes the will and intent of investors, owners, executives and employees to implement this guidance. Cyber Essentials, Cyber Essentials Plus and ISO27001 are a good start in terms of accreditation, however they don’t necessarily provide assurance that security measures are sufficient for the specific environment of a particular organisation. At the time of writing there is no substitute for a professional, independent evaluation. In all probability an international standard will eventually emerge from the guidance which will require conformity to a ‘new normal’ especially in certain circumstances, such as when an organisation applies for cyber insurance. This ‘new normal’ will likely be the kind of cyber security culture and approach that the international defence and intelligence communities have complied with for many years. For investors, whether it be a potential acquisition or an existing portfolio, the question is whether you can afford to wait for a new standard to become commonplace and adopted or whether you take a more proactive approach. We would strongly recommend that, if you haven’t already, you start to undertake cyber due diligence now against the baseline of ‘the new normal’ which has been laid out in detailed non-mandatory guidance by the UK government. Just rolling out the I.T. Manager or ticking a box against CE, CE+ or ISO27001 isn’t enough for you anymore. To satisfy you and your investors that you have identified and negotiated ownership of all cyber risk in your existing and potential portfolio, a comprehensive cyber due diligence review should be conducted. For owners and boards of businesses or organisations, the sooner you do the same and undertake a full due diligence review the sooner you will understand your risks and resilience to a threat which is only going to grow. This ‘new normal’ in security doesn’t necessarily require expensive software or infrastructure. What it does mean is that things might be a little bit less convenient, a tad slower, and your employees might complain initially about some of the restrictions. However, with commitment to cultural as well as technology change and a common set of consequence-led objectives you will adapt and be a stronger organisation as a result. The rate of cyber-attacks has remained high in the UK for the last two years despite best efforts. The average financial impact of these attacks has increased by 400% in the same time period. This is in spite of some excellent work, particularly in the UK, to reduce the frequency and impact of cyber-attacks. Don’t wait to find out the hard way that what is currently accepted as ‘normal’ is not good enough. This is cultural, technological and business change. We must do more and keep doing more.

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Cyber Security in the Supply Chain: You’re as Vulnerable as your Weakest Link It’s easy to look at the 2018 British Airways website hack and the resultant c5% fall in the IAG (BA’s parent company) share price, with a certain sense of detachment. It’s a strange phenomenon that this type of headline is at least a monthly occurrence but still companies often adopt a “minimum effort + fingers crossed” type of approach to cyber security, particularly across their supply chain. At their worst, cyber-attacks can present an existential threat to businesses and should be treated accordingly, after all, you wouldn’t leave your business premises unlocked overnight and keep your fingers crossed. What makes things more complicated and more tempting for observers to bury their heads in the sand is that the breach in the BA website case, was likely a third-party supplier providing elements of the web commerce facility, not BA itself. With malicious code available to virtually anyone who is interested, often via the dark web, the hacking of corporate systems is becoming ubiquitous. We should all face up to the reality that an intentional breach to our IT systems is inevitable. This pragmatic approach to the issue may on the surface, seem to be pessimistic and in some cases does take a brave manager to pursue. The costs of preparing for an incident which has not yet happened can be labelled as nugatory spend by those with too narrow a view on the bottom line. However, the actions that will serve to mitigate this risk, including planning and exercising for a breach, will serve to minimise the impact (and therefore the costs) when it does happen. Just spend some time and think about the data you pass to your customers, suppliers and beyond. As a minimum these organisations will store data about you including your company bank details, address, VAT number and the values of your orders. This is already information that would be useful to some hackers wishing to expand their knowledge of the pattern of activity of your company, particularly those with criminal intent. Couple this with your company email addresses, website address, passwords to your portal, intellectual property/designs and management information relating to your engagement and you are (or you should be) starting to look and feel quite vulnerable. Every time you reach outside of the inbuilt protections of your own company you are opening up to additional risk. The key is understanding these risks and putting sufficient mitigations in place to manage the aggregate risk down to acceptable levels. Mitigation approaches can be technical in nature (encryption, secure cloud etc) but are equally likely to involve process and procedural aspects. It’s important to note that the highest risks to an organisation’s security include insider threat and procedural malpractice. The agreement and policing of understandable and achievable terms in contracts with your supply chain partners should underpin these approaches and mandate proliferation of good practices down the supply chain. Documenting the minimum standards that you expect of your customers and suppliers is crucial and these standards can be made essential (i.e. the remedy for a breach becomes potential termination) to your agreement through the use of a number of contractual instruments. Supporting this by undertaking regular status reviews is essential. A review of an organisation’s cyber health is really only as good as the day on which it is conducted so reviews should be regular and comprehensive. The cost of these measures could potentially be borne by the supplier as “cost of sales” and, to keep costs down your policy may allow for the organisation to routinely self-certify with occasional audits by you or your authorised agents. As well as giving a company the confidence to conduct its business digitally, It stands to reason that companies following such a robust approach to cyber security as well as being in a much better and safer position to conduct business in the 21st century, should also receive the more peripheral benefits including lower insurance premiums, higher consumer confidence in engaging through e-commerce and compliance to some potentially quite punitive legislation. Cyber security protects the foundations of your business. Extending this critical business function out to your supply chain is a no-brainer.

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Protect Everything, Harden What’s Critical When prioritising cyber security objectives, it’s tempting to identify what you deem to be business-critical and focus your investment of resources in this area. Whilst taking this approach will no doubt improve your resilience, there is a danger of overlooking other key components of your operations. As well as the possibility of ‘cumulative critical impact’, vulnerabilities in these key (but non-critical) components could also provide an attacker a back door into your well-protected critical systems. For example, even an air-gapped isolated network is vulnerable to cyber attacks if files or software applications are being manually uploaded or updated from other internet-connected networks within your internal infrastructure or supply chain. Another example would be if only technology is applied as a protection measure without addressing education and culture. All the technology available today will still not necessarily prevent human error, or a malicious action, from inside your security perimeter creating a vulnerability or breach. When conducting due diligence projects, our approach at CYSIAM is to identify whether appropriate cyber security measures are in place across an organisation, and where necessary additional hardening of defences are in place to protect what’s critical. We conduct technical and non-technical assessments of the following: Governance Policy, process & procedure Technology Data handling Education & culture Physical environment Supply chain We then, in consultation with our clients, conduct specialist action and analysis such as penetration testing, digital forensics, insider threat, and threat intelligence in areas that are agreed as business-critical. Business criticality can be measured as a factor of likelihood of attack x level of consequence with consequences such as financial impact, loss of reputation, interruption of service, and legal non-compliance being considered amongst others. As with any tailorable assessment process, the scope for consideration should be one of depth, not breadth. All areas should be in scope with risk-based decisions made around how deep the assessment activities should go. This decision is often based on finance and resources available, or maybe time constraints, particularly in investment scenarios. This could well result in a drive to focus on protecting critical systems and data, but we must recognise that everything interacts in a digitally-connected organisation and threat actors are opportunistic and indiscriminate. A holistic approach to conducting the basics well is still the best defence against the evolving cyber threat.

Whilst taking this approach will no doubt improve your resilience, there is a danger of overlooking other key components of your operations. As well as the possibility of ‘cumulative critical impact’, vulnerabilities in these key (but non-critical) components could also provide an attacker a back door into your well-protected critical systems. For example, even an air-gapped isolated network is vulnerable to cyber attacks if files or software applications are being manually uploaded or updated from other internet-connected networks within your internal infrastructure or supply chain. Another example would be if only technology is applied as a protection measure without addressing education and culture. All the technology available today will still not necessarily prevent human error, or a malicious action, from inside your security perimeter creating a vulnerability or breach. When conducting due diligence projects, our approach at CYSIAM is to identify whether appropriate cyber security measures are in place across an organisation, and where necessary additional hardening of defences are in place to protect what’s critical. We conduct technical and non-technical assessments of the following: Governance Policy, process & procedure Technology Data handling Education & culture Physical environment Supply chain We then, in consultation with our clients, conduct specialist action and analysis such as penetration testing, digital forensics, insider threat, and threat intelligence in areas that are agreed as business-critical. Business criticality can be measured as a factor of likelihood of attack x level of consequence with consequences such as financial impact, loss of reputation, interruption of service, and legal non-compliance being considered amongst others. As with any tailorable assessment process, the scope for consideration should be one of depth, not breadth. All areas should be in scope with risk-based decisions made around how deep the assessment activities should go. This decision is often based on finance and resources available, or maybe time constraints, particularly in investment scenarios. This could well result in a drive to focus on protecting critical systems and data, but we must recognise that everything interacts in a digitally-connected organisation and threat actors are opportunistic and indiscriminate. A holistic approach to conducting the basics well is still the best defence against the evolving cyber threat.

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Cyber Risk: For Smart People Who Haven’t Studied Computer Science The torrent of jargon that I.T. people use can be overwhelming. We know because we’ve experienced first hand, the glazed eye “get me out of this conversation now” look on the faces of non-technical staff across the strata of organisations. This isn’t another article written in wiggly-amps to convince all of you that you need to dig deep to buy an expensive vendor-supplied security solution. Hopefully, this will help you start to understand what you need to know, and do, to better understand and manage cyber risk in your organisation. Understand what’s critical Sadly, if someone really wants to electronically break into your organisation and steal your data or be generally disruptive, with enough time and resource they will succeed. The first action for any organisation wishing to prepare for this inevitability is to identify the most important things to protect.This could be customer data, financial transaction data, continuity of service or intellectual property all of which, if stolen or disrupted, could impact on your reputation and/or prosperity. This list is not exhaustive and it will likely be a combination of these and other examples that form the priority items. Before any assessment of the risk can take place, it’s important that these priority areas are identified and ranked using the potential severity of the consequences of loss or damage. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst Following on from point 1, it is important that the impact on operational performance resulting from a security breach is minimised. Given the statistical probability of an attack taking place, preparing to recover from a breach is just as important as trying to prevent one. Regularly backing-up your most important data, disaster recovery exercises, and a well understood incident response policy and process are critical. Asking the question ‘what’s your role when we are hacked?’ is a good way to test your workforce’s awareness of your incident response policy and processes. It’s not all doom and gloom The good news is that the basics done well, monitored, and assessed regularly will prevent the majority of cyber attacks. The NCSCs 10 steps or the Australian Cyber Centre’s essential 8 give a solid introduction to the preparations that any organisation can do to protect its data without spending a small fortune. They provide a reliable baseline to help an organisation understand the minimum requirements of a coherent approach and provide a solid foundation upon which to build. In the UK, Cyber Essentials accreditation is a great starting point for any organisation. Don’t fire and forget Frequently evaluating your risk profile is important as the biggest risk to an organisation is not understanding the scale or range of risks. The threats posed to your business are evolving daily, the technical security that was good enough yesterday may not give adequate protection tomorrow. We provide a range of risk assessments and awareness training that will give your organisation a better understanding of what it needs to know and do in order to manage the extant cyber risk. In summary, there are 4 key areas on which we would recommend organisation’s focus: Identify and prioritise what is critical to your business and ensure systems are patched and protected. Plan for a breach and prepare your response. Back-up often and ensure you can recover quickly. Complete the information assurance basics as a foundation and build your capability from that baseline. Two-factor authentication is simple to implement and effective at stopping a range of attacks. Regularly test your defensive security and ability to respond. Independent assessments will give you an un-biased view of your resilience to attack. Manage your risk, don’t try to remove risk simply through expensive vendor solutions.

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Supporting Veterans Transition to Civilian Life As a veteran-owned and operated company, CYSIAM understands the importance of supporting those who have served in the military and their transition into civilian life. That's why we are proud to partner with TechVets, an organisation that helps veterans and service leavers find employment in the technology industry. In a recent LinkedIn post, we shared a video that discusses the positive impact that veterans can have on a company's culture. We believe that employing veterans not only helps individuals transition into civilian life, but also brings valuable skills and experiences to the workplace. At CYSIAM, we have seen first-hand the benefits of hiring veterans. We have found that veterans possess a unique set of skills, such as adaptability, problem-solving, and leadership, that are essential in the technology industry. Furthermore, veterans often have a strong work ethic and a commitment to teamwork that can help foster a positive and productive work environment. We encourage other organisations to pledge their commitment to supporting veterans by signing up to the Armed Forces Covenant. This pledge demonstrates a commitment to supporting veterans and their families and can lead to a more diverse and inclusive workplace. We want to thank TechVets for the opportunity to share our experience in employing veterans, and for their ongoing work to support veterans in the technology industry.

That's why we are proud to partner with TechVets, an organisation that helps veterans and service leavers find employment in the technology industry. In a recent LinkedIn post, we shared a video that discusses the positive impact that veterans can have on a company's culture. We believe that employing veterans not only helps individuals transition into civilian life, but also brings valuable skills and experiences to the workplace. At CYSIAM, we have seen first-hand the benefits of hiring veterans. We have found that veterans possess a unique set of skills, such as adaptability, problem-solving, and leadership, that are essential in the technology industry. Furthermore, veterans often have a strong work ethic and a commitment to teamwork that can help foster a positive and productive work environment. We encourage other organisations to pledge their commitment to supporting veterans by signing up to the Armed Forces Covenant. This pledge demonstrates a commitment to supporting veterans and their families and can lead to a more diverse and inclusive workplace. We want to thank TechVets for the opportunity to share our experience in employing veterans, and for their ongoing work to support veterans in the technology industry.

The online event will take place on 21 st March 2023 from 12:00-13:00 , where our panel of legal and cyber experts will explore how law firms can protect against cyber-attacks, detect suspicious activity, and know how to properly respond. The contributors on this panel will include: James Cassidy – Bevan Brittan - Partner and Head of Information Law & Privacy, Co-lead on Digital Health Mark Day – Law South Group Limited - Chief Executive Officer Bethan Griffiths – RPC - Senior Associate for Cyber, Technology and Data Protection David Allan – CYSIAM , UK-based 24/7 Managed Security partner - Managing Director and CTO We know that reputation is important to law firms, however, so do the attackers. We see an increase in extortion in the legal sector due to the economies of scale that an attacker can gain from compromising the sensitive client data or trust that is critical to law firms. The opportunity to exploit the legal sector has grown with the accelerated adoption of digital technologies in a historically paper-based sector. This, along with the increased sophistication of cyber criminals, means the threat to the UK legal sector is high.

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy Maven VCTs invest in cybersecurity firm CYSIAM The Maven VCTs have invested £1.15 million in CYSIAM , a cybersecurity business that provides advice, training, and managed services in cyber and secure technology systems. Maven Capital Partners (“Maven”), one of the UK’s most active private equity houses, has invested £1.15 million in CYSIAM, a cybersecurity business that provides advice, training, and managed services in cyber and secure technology systems. CYSIAM brings deep technical expertise, project delivery skills, and operational support experience to a diverse range of organisations across both government and the private sector. Founded three years ago, CYSIAM has rapidly expanded its capabilities to include international capacity building and cyber defence operations, up to and including a wraparound Managed Service for clients seeking a fully outsourced cybersecurity solution. The Maven VCTs investment in CYSIAM is the first external capital raised by the company since its inception in 2019. The business has already built up an impressive portfolio, working with central government, public sector services, Big Four consultancy firms, and an ever-growing list of high profile private sector clients. Of particular note, CYSIAM is a partner to KPMG in the delivery of the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) Digital Access Programme which aims to catalyse more inclusive, affordable, safe and secure digital access for excluded and underserved communities in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Brazil and Indonesia. CYSIAM is also expanding its existing client base in the Legal and Financial Services sectors, supporting firms in the design, enhancement, and delivery of operational resilience strategies. Maven’s investment in CYSIAM will allow the team to further develop CYSIAM’s services and brand awareness, with a specific focus to scale the Managed Services business whilst building on their more established core revenue streams. The investment builds on Maven’s strong track record in the cybersecurity space, which includes investments such as Quorum Cyber and Symphonic Software, which Maven exited for a 6.5x and 2.9x return respectively. The sector is experiencing rapid growth as a result of prolific digitalisation across all sectors and a commensurate rise in cybercrime – a trend catalysed by the disruption and change to working patterns brought about by the pandemic. Catrin Dilloway, Investment Manager at Maven said: “We are delighted to be announcing this investment in CYSIAM, a Company that has demonstrated its tremendous capability in an exciting marketplace, and that is already working with a diverse base of exceptionally high-quality clients. We have been impressed by the experience and expertise of the team at CYSIAM, the culture they have developed and the reputation they have in their sector. We look forward to partnering with them over the coming years to develop the company’s offerings and scale the business further.” Steve Lancaster, CEO of CYSIAM said: “ Dave, James and I are delighted to have an experienced investor like Maven working alongside us. We founded CYSIAM three years ago and are extremely proud of the world class team that we have assembled so far . With Maven’s support, we will continue to grow our reputation as the partner of choice, dedicated to protecting our clients’ success. From our Cyber Capacity Building work with international governments, to our Cyber Defence Operations projects delivering end-to-end managed security services, everyone at CYSIAM is passionate about making the digital world a safe, secure, and more prosperous place.” -ENDS- Further Information For media enquiries or any questions about the investment, please contact: Sapience Communications (PR to Maven) Richard Morgan Evans 020 3195 3240 rmorganevans@sapiencecomms.co.uk Maven Capital Partners Steven Ford 07580 792 608 steven.ford@mavencp.com Notes to Editors About Maven Capital Partners UK LLP ( www.mavencp.com ) Maven Capital Partners UK LLP (Maven) is a leading private equity house focused on the provision of flexible funding for high growth businesses, and one of the most active investors in smaller companies in the UK.

Of particular note, CYSIAM is a partner to KPMG in the delivery of the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) Digital Access Programme which aims to catalyse more inclusive, affordable, safe and secure digital access for excluded and underserved communities in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Brazil and Indonesia. CYSIAM is also expanding its existing client base in the Legal and Financial Services sectors, supporting firms in the design, enhancement, and delivery of operational resilience strategies. Maven’s investment in CYSIAM will allow the team to further develop CYSIAM’s services and brand awareness, with a specific focus to scale the Managed Services business whilst building on their more established core revenue streams. The investment builds on Maven’s strong track record in the cybersecurity space, which includes investments such as Quorum Cyber and Symphonic Software, which Maven exited for a 6.5x and 2.9x return respectively. The sector is experiencing rapid growth as a result of prolific digitalisation across all sectors and a commensurate rise in cybercrime – a trend catalysed by the disruption and change to working patterns brought about by the pandemic. Catrin Dilloway, Investment Manager at Maven said: “We are delighted to be announcing this investment in CYSIAM, a Company that has demonstrated its tremendous capability in an exciting marketplace, and that is already working with a diverse base of exceptionally high-quality clients. We have been impressed by the experience and expertise of the team at CYSIAM, the culture they have developed and the reputation they have in their sector. We look forward to partnering with them over the coming years to develop the company’s offerings and scale the business further.” Steve Lancaster, CEO of CYSIAM said: “ Dave, James and I are delighted to have an experienced investor like Maven working alongside us. We founded CYSIAM three years ago and are extremely proud of the world class team that we have assembled so far . With Maven’s support, we will continue to grow our reputation as the partner of choice, dedicated to protecting our clients’ success.

Privacy Policy | CYSIAM Standard Terms of Business | Sustainability and Environmental Policy CYSIAM partners with Crowdstrike to secure clients’ operations. 30th June 2021 – Press Release: The cyber security firm CYSIAM announced it is partnering with CrowdStrike, a leader in cloud-delivered endpoint and workload protection, to utilise the CrowdStrike Falcon Overwatch solution as part of CYSIAM’s new Cyber Defence Operations (CDO) service. CYSIAM will launch their CDO service formally over the summer of 2021 throughout the UK, having been developed over the past two years to meet growing demand for affordable, but highly effective, protection against the exponentially increasing threat of ransomware attacks across multiple sectors. “This past year demand for incident response has gone through the roof,” said Dave Allan, managing director and chief technology officer of CYSIAM, “re-use of state-developed techniques by criminals coupled with a low barrier to entry for ransomware capability and the increased attack surface created by the COVID pandemic has increased an already rapidly escalating threat curve” . The CYSIAM solution will bring together best-of-breed technology with operational experience and expertise, at a price point that works. CYSIAM threat analysts and incident responders are all security cleared by the UK government and have experience of operating in some of the world’s most high threat and pressurised environments. The CYSIAM solution comprises: 24/7 Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) : Delivers visibility and in-depth analysis of endpoints through CrowdStrike’s Falcon OverWatch to automatically detect suspicious activity and ensure stealthy attacks – and breaches – are stopped before they turn into serious incidents. Network Intrusion detection System (NIDS) : Places strategic point(s) within the network to monitor traffic to and from all connected devices. Once an attack is identified, or abnormal behaviour is sensed, the alert can be sent to the analyst for further action. Threat Intelligence (TI) : Our multilingual intelligence experts bring a combination of human and technology capability that aggregates, correlates, and analyses threat data from multiple sources in real time to support defensive actions. Emergency Incident Response : Security cleared expert response and investigation team is ready to deploy at short notice to serious attacks with full working knowledge of your business operations and IT infrastructure. Digital Forensics : An investigations capability which can span all device-types, rapidly acquiring data to a secure environment and conducting root cause analysis, providing confidence the threat is removed and informing remediation activities. Threat Hunting : The team hunts relentlessly to see and stop the stealthiest sophisticated threats: the 1% of 1% of threats that blend in silently and lead to a breach if they remain undetected. “What we see all the time” , Dave added, “is medium-size organisations that can afford technology but not a team of expertise, so products get bought and are either quite ineffective, or misconfigured giving a false sense of security. What we have put together is a fully outsourced solution which is technically world-leading, but also affordable for all who take cyber risk and operational resilience seriously”. When asked why CYSIAM chose to partner with CrowdStrike over their competitors, Dave pointed to CrowdStrike’s performance, technical versatility, and fearsome reputation with offensive security experts. “We have taken the advice of red teaming experts that we respect greatly, and the adversary they dread the most is CrowdStrike. For us, that is the best endorsement. That, coupled with the ability to integrate the CrowdStrike product range with our existing technology stack, is why we chose this exciting partnership”.
